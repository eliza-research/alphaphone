/**
 * Per-turn voice latency records, kept only on this device. A record holds a random turn
 * id, the speech route, whether the turn was cold, and millisecond offsets from the end of
 * recording. It never holds transcript or reply text, account, agent or conversation
 * identifiers. Export produces the JSON that `scripts/aggregate-voice-latency.mjs` reads.
 *
 * Marks: recording-end (offset 0), transcript-ready, send, first-token, final-reply,
 * first-audio. Each mark is recorded once (first wins) and must not precede the mark before
 * it, so a late or out-of-order observation cannot shorten a measured phase.
 *
 * A record started by an app entrypoint also names that entry ('conversation' for the Cloud
 * voice conversation on Home or another view, 'notes' for the Notes recorder) and the send
 * policy in force. The marks are raw: whether review time counts toward a target (A-10) is
 * decided by the aggregator's boundary, never by moving a mark.
 *
 * A live turn (the agent's streaming ASR, live-voice.ts) also carries `live`: the ASR mode and
 * numbers only — partial count, speech-start to first partial, speech-end to final on this
 * client, and the agent's own last-frame to final. Never text.
 *
 * A voice-assistant turn (#423) also carries `endpoint`: which path submitted it (`semantic`, the
 * end-of-turn chain, or `gap`, the long silence gap), the chain's outcome enum, its unavailable
 * reason enum (scorer or `clef-*`), latency and the chain stage that answered (`path`: `local`, the
 * resident's fused scorer, or `clef`); and `heard`: the outcome enum of recording heard-only content
 * after an interruption, including a reply interrupted before any of it played (voice-turn-routes.ts).
 * Never text.
 *
 * On the phone, a conversation turn's transcript-ready, send and first-token marks are also
 * reported to the native latency collector (issue #395) through a sink the platform installs
 * (native-voice-turn.ts). Native stamps them on its monotonic clock and links them to the live
 * capture turn by a random native turn id, which this record keeps as `nativeTurn` and the reply's
 * synthesis echoes. Only the stage name and that id cross the bridge: never text.
 *
 * The recorder is the shared upstream `@elizaos/voice/turn-timing` (projected from the reviewed
 * pin). Alpha keeps only its installed identifiers (storage key, export format), its speech route
 * and entry names, and these function exports so callers, the aggregator and diagnostics keep
 * their contract. Function declarations only: Node contract tests evaluate this source.
