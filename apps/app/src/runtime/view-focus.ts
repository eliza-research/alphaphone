/**
 * Focus follows the screen (PRD AP-15: TalkBack, keyboard and repeated HOME).
 *
 * The behaviour is Eliza's `createScreenFocus` (`@elizaos/ui/accessibility`): focus that a screen
 * change, an inline modal surface (the All apps drawer) or a rotation dropped to the page body moves
 * to what is now in front, made programmatically focusable only (tabindex -1) and focused without
 * scrolling, so TalkBack announces where the person is and Tab continues from there. Focus a view or
 * the person put somewhere real is never moved.
 *
 * This file only tells it about Alpha's renderer:
 *
 * - the screen's name: the visible title of the app in front (`[data-alpha-app-title]`; the app's
 *   labelled region where it has no title row, as in Maps and the browser page), or the Home
 *   region when Home is in front;
 * - surfaces that manage their own focus: the conversation, the voice panel (and open native
 *   dialogs, which the shared module always includes);
 * - screen changes: `data-active-view` on the root element, and HOME pressed on Home
 *   (`launcher-home`), which changes no view but can still drop focus;
 * - startup: the first view of a page load is not a screen change, and nothing is judged before it
 *   (startup dialogs own focus then).
