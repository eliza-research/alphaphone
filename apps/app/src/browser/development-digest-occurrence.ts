 * (`plugins/plugin-workflow/src/services/hosted-digest-policy.ts`, used by `digestAdmission`); this
 * file adds only the development scheduler's civil-time bookkeeping:
 *  - a lapsed source is checked first and yields one explicit `unavailable` record that pauses the
 *    schedule until a new source is reviewed;
 *  - an occurrence later than the shared run window (30 minutes) is recorded as `missed` and never run;
 *  - an occurrence is settled at most once.
 * Development schedules exist only with ELIZA_DEV_ALLOW_TEST_MOCKS.
