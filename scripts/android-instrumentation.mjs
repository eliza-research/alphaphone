/**
 * Install both distribution variants with their instrumentation APKs on an owned,
 * disposable emulator and run a named class list or the whole androidTest suite.
 *
 *   npm run test:android:instrumentation -- --owned-emulator --avd <name> \
 *     [--serial emulator-5554] [--classes NoMockProduct,Shell,StartupReadiness | --all] \
 *     [--variants standalone,launcher] [--test-mocks] [--apk-dir artifacts] \
 *     [--output test-results/android-instrumentation/<run>] [--timeout-ms 900000] \
 *     [--clock-exclusive] [--home-role] [--live-network]
 *
 * --live-network passes each class's `liveArgs` gate (BrowserFlow's browserFlowLive=1): the methods
 * that load a public third-party page run only when the emulator has network and this is asked for.
 *
 * Variants share one package id and replace each other, so they run one after the
 * other: install app + test APK, check the installed bytes, run every class in its
 * own `am instrument` process after clearing the app's data, uninstall. Only packages this run installed are
 * removed; an existing Alpha installation is refused, never replaced.
 *
 * --home-role (launcher variant only) is the one phase that changes a device role: it records
 * the emulator's HOME holder, runs the classes that request the role themselves, selects the
 * launcher APK as HOME, cold-starts it with the HOME key, runs the classes that need Alpha to be
 * HOME, and always puts the original HOME back. If that cannot be proven the run fails, the
 * installed packages are left in place and the emulator must not be reused until it is recovered.
 *
 * Classes that assert a disposable secondary Android user (HostedProcessRestart,
 * HostedBackgroundWorker) run in their own phase per variant: the runner creates a fresh user
 * with the upstream lifecycle helper the other campaigns use, makes the two installed packages
 * available to it, runs each class there, removes the packages from that user and lets the
 * helper switch back to the owner and remove the user. A user that cannot be removed fails the run.
 *
 * Results: <output>/results.json via scripts/instrumentation-result.mjs, bound to
 * the source commit and every installed APK's SHA-256, with raw output per class.
 * This is emulator-class evidence (class E). It is not physical-device, AOSP image,
 * real-integration or user acceptance.
