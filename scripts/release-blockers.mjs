/**
 * Named reasons a verify-apks release row may not be distributed: Alpha's policy binding of
 * the shared judgement (vendor/eliza/packages/os/scripts/android/apk-release-record.mjs).
 *
 * The shared function reads one recorded row back and names every blocker (test mocks, the
 * flag-off bundle audit, signing, the packaged runtime and its notices, on-device voice and,
 * for an image, the reviewed platform certificate). Alpha supplies only its policy:
 * - signer: `releaseSigner` (the committed android/release-signer.json) recomputes admission
 *   with build-android's releaseAdmission, so an unset signer always blocks;
 * - licences: open-source licence flags never block (decision P-09). The single item that can
 *   is the separately named `unresolved-font-licence` check for a proprietary font with no
 *   recorded licence, and only while UNRESOLVED_FONT_LICENCE_BLOCKS_DISTRIBUTION
 *   (scripts/licence-policy.mjs) is true.
 *
 * @param {Record<string, any>} row one `results[]` entry with mode "release"
 * @param {{manifestTestMocks?: unknown, admission?: {failures: string[], blockers: string[], signerMatches?: boolean}, releaseSigner?: Record<string, any>, image?: {platformCertificateSha256?: unknown}, fontLicenceBlocks?: boolean}} [options]
 * @returns {string[]}
