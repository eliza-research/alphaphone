# Gesture zones and Android's notification shade

This page says which swipes belong to Android and which to Alpha, and how a person reaches
notifications and quick settings. It records the behaviour in source after the owner's
2026-10-12 decisions A-32 and A-33 (issues #416 and #417): `apps/app/src/prototype/model.js`,
`system-shade.ts`, `template.html`, `phone.css`, `SystemShade.java` and `AlphaDevicePlugin.java`.
Browser tests are Chromium on a development or production build. They are not emulator,
TalkBack, AOSP-image or device evidence; the instrumented classes named at the end have not
been run at this source.

## The rule

Android's shade is the one notification and quick-settings surface. Alpha posts its notices
(workflow results and approvals, hosted results, reminders) as ordinary Android notifications
whose taps are bound to their owner (`WorkflowNoticeTaps`, `HostedNoticePoster`), and Android
shows, taps, clears and silences them. Alpha draws no notification panel, no quick-settings
tiles and no brightness control of its own in any product build. Workflow history stays in
Alpha (Home's Workflows card, then History); Settings stays reachable from Home.

The earlier Alpha panel, opened from a "Notifications" handle on Home, competed with Android's
shade and is removed from product builds. The browser development build
(`ELIZA_DEV_ALLOW_TEST_MOCKS=1`, not on Android) keeps it only as a stand-in for Android's
SystemUI, because a browser has none; it is a developer surface (`simulatedShade`).

## The zones

| Zone | Owner | What happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A downward swipe from the top edge of the screen (the status bar) | Android | Android opens its own shade, in both flavors. Alpha does not answer it. |
| Launcher Home: the "Notifications" button | Alpha asks Android | Asks Android to expand its shade (`AlphaDevice.openNotificationShade`). |
| Launcher Home: a downward pull that starts on empty Home | Alpha asks Android | The same request. See "Empty Home" below for what is not empty Home. |
| Standalone app: any downward pull on Home | Nobody in Alpha | An ordinary app: Android's top-edge swipe is the way in. No button. |
| A swipe in from the left or right edge | Android (gesture navigation) | Android delivers Back. In the browser build the same swipe within 30px of an edge goes Back. |
| A swipe up from the bottom edge | Android (gesture navigation) | Android delivers HOME; the launcher flavor shows Alpha Home. |
| A swipe up on Alpha Home, away from the bottom edge | Alpha | Opens the conversation sheet. |

## Empty Home

`emptyHomeShadePull` in `system-shade.ts` decides. A pull asks for Android's shade only when all
of these hold:

- the launcher presentation, not the standalone app or the assistant surface;
- Home with nothing over it: no app view, conversation sheet or full chat, voice session,
  app drawer, secure (locked camera) state or development shade;
- a clearly downward pull: more than 46 canvas pixels, and more than 1.5 times its sideways
  travel (a card row or Back is sideways);
- it started below Android's 44px status bar band (a pull from there is Android's own);
- it started inside the Home layer, not on an editable element, not while a text field has focus
  (the keyboard may be up), and not on content that is scrolled away from its top (that content
  scrolls back first).

On a phone the WebView may take a vertical drag for scrolling before the page sees it. A Home
whose content fits the screen is marked `data-alpha-home-fits="true"` and gives vertical drags to
the page (`touch-action: pan-x pinch-zoom`). A Home that overflows (launcher landscape, large
text or display size) scrolls normally; only at its top, where it cannot scroll further down, does
Alpha take a clearly downward drag on empty Home from the WebView (a non-passive `touchmove` that
calls `preventDefault`, `overflowPullDecision` in `system-shade.ts`), so that pull reaches Alpha
too. Upward drags, sideways drags and drags on a Home scrolled away from its top stay the
WebView's. Chromium's touch pipeline is covered by the landscape case in
`notifications-handle.spec.ts`; whether the AOSP image's WebView delivers either path is not
measured.

## The Notifications button

- Launcher Home only. A button labelled "Notifications" with a bell, centred at the top of Home.
  Its accessible name is "Open notifications" and its description says it opens Android's
  notifications and quick settings. It controls no Alpha region.
- Target size: at least 44 by 44 pixels of the 412px canvas at every supported text size, below
  Android's status bar. When Android reports a taller bar (`--native-top-inset`, set by
  `MainActivity`), Home's top padding grows so the button starts at least 12 screen pixels
  below it, measured in screen pixels on the scaled canvas.
- Ways to activate: tap or click, Enter or Space, the accessibility click action (TalkBack's
  double tap, Switch Access), or a pull down that starts on it.

## Asking Android

`AlphaDevice.openNotificationShade` (launcher flavor) calls
`StatusBarManager.expandNotificationsPanel` by reflection, with the install-time
`EXPAND_STATUS_BAR` permission that only the launcher flavor's manifest declares. It answers
only while Alpha's window has focus. It resolves with one status:

| Status | Meaning | What Alpha shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `opened` | Android accepted the call | Nothing more. Not a measurement that the shade is on screen. |
| `standalone` | The standalone app never asks | "Swipe down from the top edge of the screen for Android notifications." |
| `permission-missing`, `unsupported` | No permission, no status bar service, a refused or missing method | "Android did not open its notifications from Alpha. Swipe down from the top edge of the screen instead." |
| `not-in-front` | Alpha's window does not have focus | "Alpha is not in front. Swipe down from the top edge of the screen for Android notifications." |

A failed bridge call is treated as `unsupported`. No status is ever reported as opened unless
Android accepted the call.

## Tests

| Test | Lane | Shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `test/system-shade.test.mjs` | `npm test` | The decision rules for empty Home, the surface choice, the fallback text, the template and model gates, the launcher-only permission and the native outcome mapping (source shape). |
| `test/gesture-zones-single-instance.test.mjs` | `npm test` | The swipe handler only asks for Android's shade; the development stand-in is gated; no instrumented test still looks for an Alpha panel. |
| `test/browser/notifications-handle.spec.ts` | `npm run test:browser` | Standalone: no button, no pull opens anything. Launcher (with the development stand-in): the button's name, size and position; tap, Enter, Space, accessibility click, a pull on the button and a pull on empty Home open it; the status bar band, sideways drags, an open sheet, an app view, a focused composer and a scrolled Home do not; in landscape an overflowing Home still scrolls with touch and a downward touch pull at its top opens the stand-in; the button clears a taller status bar at 360, 412 and 480px; 200% text. |
| `test/browser/settings-truth.production.spec.ts` | `npm run test:browser:production` | The flag-off bundle with a stubbed Android bridge: no Alpha shade, tiles or brightness; the button and an empty-Home pull call `openNotificationShade`; a focused composer does not; every non-opened outcome shows its fallback; the browser build has no shade or button. |
| `SystemShadeInstrumentedTest` | emulator | Outcome mapping; EXPAND_STATUS_BAR declared and held by the launcher flavor only; launcher Home's request and empty-Home pull open Android's shade, a focused composer does not; standalone never does. Not compiled or run at this source. |
| `NotificationsInstrumentedTest`, `NotificationChannelsInstrumentedTest` | emulator | A posted notice is found and tapped in Android's shade (opened from the launcher button, or Android's global action on standalone) and its PendingIntent fires; the page has no Alpha shade. Not compiled or run at this source. |
| `AccessibilityInstrumentedTest.homeShadeSettingsAndComposerAtDoubleFontScale` | emulator | A top-edge swipe opens Android's shade with no Alpha panel behind it; on the launcher the accessibility click action and a pull from the button open Android's shade; standalone has no button. Not compiled or run at this source. |

## Left open

- Actual AOSP portrait, landscape and lock-screen screenshots of Android's shade with Alpha's
  notices, branding, insets, Do Not Disturb, clear and tap behaviour, and the listening indicator
  (#416, with #424 for the listening tile and #425 for owner-bound reposting).
- Swipe, tap, TalkBack and return behaviour on the AOSP image and a Pixel 10a (#417).
- Asking Alpha about one of its own notices used to start from the Alpha panel. In product
  builds there is no such entry until it is offered from the notice itself (a notification
  action); the browser development stand-in still shows it for development only.
