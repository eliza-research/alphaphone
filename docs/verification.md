# Verification guide

Verification applies to the exact source revision, upstream pin and artifacts tested.
This guide defines the gates; it is not a passing test report. See the
[current capability status](mvp-current-status.md), [completion plan](mvp-completion-plan.md)
and [pilot runbook](pilot-acceptance-runbook.md) for remaining product acceptance.

## Source and packaging

Run `npm ci` and `npm run verify` with the toolchain documented in the README.
Build and stage the libelizainference voice host as described in [fused speech](fused-speech.md),
then run `npm run agent:prepare`, `npm run agent:build-workflow-worker`,
`npm run agent:stage-android` and `npm run android:build` with JDK 21 and the configured Android SDK. Plain
`npm run android:build` requires an earlier `npm run agent:prepare` and, for release
verification, `npm run agent:stage-android`.
Validate standalone and launcher distributions, each as debug and unsigned release,
including instrumentation builds, lint and APK inspection. A partial `ELIZAOS_KEYSTORE_*`/
`ELIZAOS_KEY_*` set fails the build. `verify-apks` marks a release distributable only when it
is signed by the certificate recorded in `android/release-signer.json` (`unset` until the
release keys exist) and its versionCode exceeds that file's last recorded release; a signed
release with another certificate or a non-advancing versionCode fails verification.
The committed notices carry only the umbrella runtime entry, so a staged runtime in a
development checkout never makes them stale. `node scripts/generate-licenses.mjs --packaged-runtime`
adds Bun (with its JavaScriptCore LGPL notice and source offer) and every npm package bundled
into the staged agent and workflow worker; the resident workflow runs it after staging, and an
APK built without that step does not carry those notices, and `verify-apks` never marks such a
release distributable. `--check` lists the staged runtime's
entries when one is present. Record the product commit,
`upstream.lock.json` revision, generated input provenance and APK hashes.
Unsigned release APKs require controlled signing before distribution.
The gates downstream of `verify-apks` read that record back through
`scripts/release-blockers.mjs` and name every unresolved blocker: pilot provisioning and
update (`scripts/provision-unit.mjs`, `scripts/pilot-update.mjs`) and AOSP staging
(`scripts/stage-aosp.mjs`) refuse a release that is not distributable, and
`scripts/qualify-head.mjs` records the blockers and reports `releasesDistributable: false`
while one remains. Only the debug emulator rehearsal (`--build debug`) and `--development`
staging of a debug APK proceed without a distributable release, and both are decided from
the APK file, not only its manifest row: `--development` refuses a non-debuggable APK that has
no distributable release row (a missing manifest, a row for other bytes or a row relabelled
`debug` admits nothing), and provisioning and update refuse an APK whose own web-bundle flag,
build type, packaged runtime or signing certificate contradicts the row that admitted it.
`apk-manifest.json` is an unsigned record: speech qualification and licence blockers cannot be
re-derived from the APK, so for those the manifest written by `verify-apks` is the evidence and
must come from the build being installed.

### Speech engine (decision P-42)

On-device and local speech run only on libelizainference ([fused speech](fused-speech.md)).
Each kind of evidence proves only its own class:

| Check | Class | What it does not prove |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `node --test test/llama-cpp-only.test.mjs test/voice-host-record.test.mjs`, `npm run audit:bundle` | S | That any voice-host binary exists or works |
| `test/browser/browser-speech.spec.ts` (stub agent), `production-surface.spec.ts` | S (browser) | Real agent speech quality |
| An APK whose staged voice-host libraries match `android/voice-host/qualified-voice-host.json` | B | That speech runs |
| Voice-host instrumentation on an emulator (x86_64 needs a qualified x86_64 host) | E | A phone, an AOSP image or intelligibility on hardware |
| The same on a physical phone, with a person judging transcripts and playback | D | Other devices or ABIs |

## Browser behavior

Run `npm run test:browser` for the affected flows and inspect the generated reports
and screenshots under `test-results/`. The browser workflow also exercises storage
contracts in Firefox and WebKit. Record the browser, project, test selection and
fixture profile. `scripts/storage-specs.mjs` is the shared storage-spec inventory
for browser lanes and `scripts/qualify-head.mjs`. Qualification requires every
listed spec to execute, passing terminal attempts, matching report counts and no
runner errors, skipped tests or flaky results. A simulated adapter test verifies
its contract, not a live provider.
Visual acceptance requires decoded reference assets and comparable capture geometry;
see [visual verification](prototype-visual-verification.md).

## Android and integrations

Aggregate smoke suites and CI smoke jobs were removed at the owner's request.
For separate native acceptance, use an owned disposable emulator to exercise both APK
variants, native bridge behavior and actual launcher HOME selection and restoration.
Retain terminal instrumentation results and cleanup outcomes. A build or successful
install cannot substitute for these checks.

`npm run test:android:instrumentation -- --owned-emulator --avd <name> --serial emulator-NNNN`
is the one documented instrumentation runner. It refuses physical devices and an
emulator that already has Alpha installed, takes the shared device lease, and for each
variant (standalone, then launcher; they share one package) installs the verified
debug APK with its instrumentation APK (`artifacts/instrumentation/<variant>-androidTest.apk`,
hashed in `apk-manifest.json`), checks the installed bytes, runs each class in its own
`am instrument` process with its explicit opt-in arguments, and uninstalls only what it
installed. `--classes NoMockProduct,Shell,StartupReadiness` names classes (short names
are expanded); the default list covers the product-surface classes; `--all` runs the
whole androidTest suite in one process; `--test-mocks` uses the separate
`artifacts/test-mocks/` pair for fixture-dependent classes such as BrowserAutofill
and the browser loopback cases. `<output>/results.json` (via
`scripts/instrumentation-result.mjs`) records per-class `passed`, `failed`, `skipped`
(every method skipped by its own assumption gate) or `missing`, bound to the commit, a
dirty flag and every installed APK's SHA-256, with raw output per class. It is labelled
emulator class E evidence and is never device or user acceptance. Process-death,
permission-changing and provider-credential campaigns (ReminderTapProcessDeath,
WorkflowNoticeProcessDeath, NotificationChannels, VoicePermissionDenied,
VoicePermissionRevoke, LocalVoiceRecordingLimit, ResidentEgressRedaction) are refused
there with the command of the campaign that owns them; text-scale, bookmark and sign-in restart
phases run through `scripts/test-native-restart.mjs`. Classes that assume a test-mocks app
build (ConnectionChooser, BrowserWebFeatures, CloudVoice and the other loopback-fixture
classes) are refused without `--test-mocks` instead of reporting `skipped`. The reading
classes that give the product a loopback HTTP speech route (BrowserReading,
BrowserSensitiveReading, BrowserIsolatedReading, BrowserUnsupportedReading) are among them:
a build without test mocks answers "Select an available speech route before reading" first,
which is the correct refusal when no HTTPS route exists.

Classes that assert a disposable secondary Android user (HostedProcessRestart,
HostedBackgroundWorker; both also need `--test-mocks` for their loopback HTTP fixture) run in
the runner's secondary-user phase. Per variant it creates a fresh user with the upstream
lifecycle helper the permission, restart and Calendar campaigns use, makes the two installed
packages available to it (`cmd package install-existing --user N`), runs each class and each
of its phases there (`am instrument --user N`), removes the packages from that user and lets
the helper switch back to the owner and remove the user. `results.json` lists each such user
under `secondaryUsers`; a user that is not proven removed fails the run and the console names
the recovery command. RealClock needs AOSP Clock's own notification permission, which the
runner grants (`grantOther` in the registry); the fixture is qualified for API 35 only.

`--home-role` is the runner's one phase that changes a device role, and it runs only with
`--owned-emulator` on the launcher variant:
`npm run test:android:instrumentation -- --owned-emulator --avd <name> --serial emulator-NNNN --variants launcher --home-role --classes SettingsRoles,LauncherHome`.
It requires one stock HOME app to hold the role before the run, runs SettingsRoles (which
removes the role, declines and accepts Android's own dialog and restores what it found),
selects the launcher APK with `cmd package set-home-activity`, force-stops it and requires
the HOME key to bring it to the foreground, runs LauncherHome (All-apps drawer, Settings,
the stock dialer, three installed apps with HOME returning each time, Android Settings and
the default-Home chooser still reachable), then puts the original holder back and reads it
back before uninstalling. LauncherHome and SettingsRoles are refused without `--home-role`,
so they cannot be reported as skipped. `results.json` records the original holder, the cold
HOME start and the restoration under `homeRole`; a run is not a pass without both. If the
original holder cannot be proven restored the run fails, nothing is uninstalled,
`home-role-recovery.json` gives the exact recovery command, and the emulator must not be
reused or deleted until it is recovered. This is emulator HOME-role evidence only: not
boot-time HOME, a custom image, or the recovery and emergency routes of a phone.

`test/android-instrumentation-runner.test.mjs` keeps the instrumentation sources reachable:
every class with an `@Test` method under `android/app/src/androidTest` or
`android/app/src/testMocks/androidTest` must have a `CLASS_REGISTRY` entry, be named by one
of the `CAMPAIGN_RUNNERS` scripts, or be listed in `NOT_RUN_BY_A_RUNNER` with the reason
(all three are in `scripts/android-instrumentation.mjs`). A new class with none of these
fails `npm test`, and so does a listed class that has since gained a runner. AccessibilityInstrumentedTest
(ATF plus TalkBack-order checks at 200% font) and RotationInstrumentedTest (which needs
the landscape layout and fails, not skips, without it) run through the same runner. See the [Android/AOSP guide](android-and-aosp.md)
and README for isolated Calendar and reminder regression/upgrade campaigns.

For native browser changes, qualify HTTPS navigation, back/forward/reload,
loading/title/address state, tab/profile isolation, and background/process recovery
on both variants. Exercise TLS failures, disallowed redirects and offline retry
against controlled endpoints. Verify renderer/profile capability admission and
that remote content cannot paint over or receive touches through host controls,
sheets or the keyboard. Phone geometry and real provider behavior require their
own evidence; desktop screenshots cannot establish native isolation.

Calendar CRUD cases run through `scripts/test-calendar-regression.mjs` with
`--case=CalendarCrudInstrumentedTest` or `--case=CalendarAgentCrudInstrumentedTest`.
`--case=` takes a class (every case of it) or `Class#method`. CalendarAgentCrud has two
cases, each with its own gate and result folder: the reviewed create/read/update/delete
method (`calendarAgent`) and `directSaveReadsBackAllDayChosenZoneAndRrule`
(`calendarOptions`). `--case=CalendarAvailabilityInstrumentedTest` runs that whole class,
which skips unless both calendar permissions are granted before it starts.
Set `ALPHA_CALENDAR_TEST_SERIAL`, `ALPHA_CALENDAR_TEST_AVD`, and
`ALPHA_CALENDAR_TEST_ABI` for the owned disposable emulator. Both distributions
run by default; `--variant=standalone` or `--variant=launcher` selects one.
These cases use the built app/test APKs, isolated-user Calendar grants, and
retained instrumentation and cleanup evidence.

The native workflow campaign uses `node scripts/android-workflow-native.mjs` with
`ANDROID_SERIAL`, `ALPHA_WORKFLOW_TEST_AVD`, `ALPHA_WORKFLOW_TEST_ABI`, and
`ALPHA_BUILD_ARCHIVE`. The archive must contain both distributions' debug and
instrumentation APKs plus their filename-to-SHA256 `apk-manifest.json`:
`node scripts/build-archive.mjs test-results/<new>` makes it from the strict build, and
`node scripts/developer-archive.mjs [--test-mocks] test-results/<new>` copies it from a
developer build that verify-apks recorded in `artifacts/` (it admits each APK against
`artifacts/apk-manifest.json` and writes `archive-source.json` saying it is a developer
archive). Evidence is written to a new `ALPHA_CAMPAIGN_OUTPUT` directory beneath
`test-results/`. `--variant=standalone|launcher` and `--phase=workflow|approval-notice`
run part of the campaign after a failure stopped it; such a report carries `selection`
and `selectionPassed`, and its `passed` stays false.
Set `ALPHA_TEST_HOME_PACKAGE` when the image’s stock launcher differs from
`com.android.launcher3` (for example, `com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher` on
Google APIs images). This also applies to Calendar and permission campaigns.
The runner refuses existing product package registrations, leases the emulator,
and runs each exact method in a fresh secondary user. It retains the fixture if
package termination or cleanup cannot be proven. These synthetic read/draft tests
do not establish paired-host workflow execution.

Native permission, restart, one-off reminder, and recurrence runners share
`scripts/native-test-fixture.mjs`: AlphaPhone owns the exact archived APK pair
and SDK configuration; upstream owns the emulator lease, isolated user, strict
instrumentation admission, and cleanup. Set `ANDROID_SERIAL`,
`ALPHA_NATIVE_TEST_AVD`, `ALPHA_NATIVE_TEST_ABI`, and the fixture's stock
`ALPHA_TEST_HOME_PACKAGE`. Supply archived app/test APK paths and a fresh output
directory. Permission changes apply only to the temporary user; successful
cleanup removes that user and restores owner 0. `user-verification.json` records
the shared lifecycle, `verification.json` the instrumentation and package
cleanup, and `result.json` the product scenario. Deferred cleanup is a failure
requiring explicit recovery of the owned fixture.

`node scripts/test-native-permissions.mjs <scenario> APP.apk TEST.apk NEW_OUTPUT` sets the
permission before the app process starts and runs one exact method:

| Scenario | Permission state | What runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `camera` | CAMERA revoked | denial and explicit retry without a fake preview |
| `settings` | fine location revoked, coarse granted | Accounts handoff and location accuracy readback |
| `channels` | POST_NOTIFICATIONS granted | a blocked channel read back, user recovery and a real notification |
| `voice` | RECORD_AUDIO revoked | the denied recorder state, Open app settings and back, no capture file, typing in the composer still works |
| `voice-revoke` | RECORD_AUDIO granted, revoked while recording, granted again | four phases in separate processes: a baseline capture; a capture during which the runner runs `pm revoke` and requires Android to end that process mid-test; a new process that finds no capture file, no active recording and no note audio; and a capture after the grant is restored |
| `voice-limit` | RECORD_AUDIO granted | the recorder stops at its limit with the full duration decodable |
| `notice` | POST_NOTIFICATIONS granted | a redacted result notice is posted, tapped and consumed once across recreation |
| `notice-denied` | POST_NOTIFICATIONS revoked | the result stays in encrypted history, no notice is posted and none is pending |

Revoking a runtime permission kills the app process, and instrumentation runs in it, so
`voice-revoke` never asks one process to observe both sides and never force-stops the app to
imitate the kill: a recording process that survives `pm revoke` fails the campaign.
`result.json` records the revocation under `revocation`. The temporary user is removed with
its grants, so nothing is restored afterwards. None of this is microphone, speaker or
notification behaviour on a phone.

Process-restart campaigns use `node scripts/test-native-restart.mjs` with `inbox`,
`notes`, `document`, `text-scale`, `tree`, `bookmark`, or `signin`, a matching archived APK pair and a new output directory.
Use the owned-emulator configuration in the README. Require successful prepare,
restore/verify and cleanup phases; Notes and Inbox reports also require distinct
process IDs. Selected-file, text-scale, folder and bookmark native tests assert process boundaries themselves.
The bookmark case also force-stops before `verifyRemoved`, requiring removal to
survive a second process restart.
Activity recreation alone is insufficient. These campaigns are no longer automatic CI
checks. Browser campaigns require a supported WebView; the stock API 35 provider
lacks the browsing-data deletion capability required by bookmark navigation.
Retain provider admission and native phase evidence separately.

Argument-gated instrumentation methods can be skipped by a full-suite invocation.
Use the exact method and explicit gate documented in its current runner/test source;
require matching start/completion identities, a successful terminal result and no
assumptions. A class listing, source count or `OK` summary does not prove the gated
flow ran. Tests needing synthetic providers or debug hooks require separately
archived test-mocks APKs. Their results cannot qualify flag-off production behavior.

Qualify real integrations separately with authorized test accounts and explicit
user actions. Record account scope without secrets, the actual operation, provider
readback, cancellation/revocation behavior and ambiguous-outcome reconciliation.
Do not count a handoff, fixture response or unavailable-provider branch as successful
provider execution. Native recording, actual captured speech and transcription also
require separate evidence; an audio injection request alone does not prove capture.

## Image, release and user acceptance

AOSP staging validates inputs; full image acceptance requires building and booting
that exact custom image and verifying its installed package, signer and HOME policy.
An SDK emulator test does not establish a custom AOSP image boot.
Physical-device qualification must cover radios, camera/audio, suspend/resume,
accessibility, recovery and signed updates/rollback. Production signing, distribution,
device-owner provisioning and target-user task acceptance remain independent gates.

## Pin move to fb62325230 (2026-10-14): agent-event IPC

Branch `claude/pin-eliza-develop-fb62325`. The pin moved from `c7a9a0d7e7` to `fb62325230`, the
elizaOS `develop` head (289 files) that contains the live agent-event feed over the private agent
IPC (#36261, `f7f3765d0a`) and the Alpha Phone sign-in callback contract (#36271, `d4de8c1cd7`),
with the llama.cpp gitlink `56e70ff2` (llama.cpp `main` after elizaOS/llama.cpp#72, the upstream
runtime integration; voice ABI 18 unchanged) and `MTMD_VIDEO=OFF` in `stage-elizavoice-lib.ts`
(#36279). The seven `patches/eliza` targets are unchanged and every patch applies at the new pin.
Alpha Phone does not consume the new event feed yet. No emulator, device, AOSP image or hosted
run; nothing installed.

- `npm run upstream:verify`: source verified at `fb62325230`; reachability re-recorded
  (`identical` to `develop`, 2026-10-14) with #36271 and #36261 added to the record.
- `npm run upstream:prepare-client`: the voice projection inputs are unchanged at the new pin.
- Engine (class B): `scripts/prepare-embedding-host.mjs --build --remap-build-path` (NDK 28.2)
  rebuilt the engine and the registered `ElizaVoiceNative` JNI for both ABIs at the pin with a
  clean llama.cpp checkout at `56e70ff2` (receipt checks passed: ELF ABI, embedding symbols, only
  `JNI_OnLoad` exported, 16 KiB alignment; 85 `eliza_inference_*` exports including the six
  `asr_stream_*`, Parakeet-TDT enabled). Those engine bytes are now the voice host record's, and
  they are the embedding host record's candidate build. Both records stay unqualified; the
  embedding host requalification note now names this pin. The bundle assets were not rebuilt (their
  converters are unchanged), the voice-subset `libparadeevoicejni.so` was not rebuilt, and nothing
  was staged, packaged into an APK or executed.
- Resident dependency audit re-recorded at the pin: GHSA-w4pp-8pjf-rmxw (pacote) is no longer
  resolved, so its exception was removed; no new advisory. Third-party notices regenerated for the
  new engine identity (licence flags unchanged in kind).
- `npm run --ignore-scripts typecheck` passed; `node --test test/*.test.mjs`: 1252 of 1252 passed;
  `npm run verify` passed (production web bundle audit clean).

## Pin move to c7a9a0d7e7 (2026-10-14): Phonon-2 and live voice

Branch `claude/mvp-final` (not pushed). The pin moved from `644d56c93d` to `c7a9a0d7e7`, the
elizaOS `develop` head (41 commits) that contains Phonon-2 (#36212, `d06a1aa9c9`), streaming ASR
(#36213, `d68909cb`), live voice (#36214, `70dc0bbf`) and the voice gap fixes (#36239), with the
llama.cpp gitlink `5df17a66` (llama.cpp `main` with elizaOS/llama.cpp#79). `vendor/eliza` is a
standalone clone checked out at the pin; its nested llama.cpp is a fresh shallow clone at the
gitlink. The nine `patches/eliza` targets are unchanged between the two pins. Development machine
under heavy load from other sessions (load average 25 to 100). No emulator, device, AOSP image or
hosted run; nothing installed.

- `npm run upstream:verify`: source verified at `c7a9a0d7e7`; reachability re-recorded
  (`identical` to `develop`, 2026-10-14) with #36212, #36213, #36214 and #36239 added to the record.
- Engine and bundle (class B): `packages/app/scripts/paradee-voice/build-native.ts` at the pin
  (NDK 28.2) built both ABIs with `LLAMA_BUILD_PARAKEET=ON` and eSpeak NG `N_PATH_HOME=1024`
  (voice ABI 18, `paradee_supported()=1`, `asr_supported()=1`, 83 exports, LOAD alignment 16 KiB)
  and converted the Paradee GGUF (now `357477…`, the v1_0 metadata of #36239) and the misaki
  lexicon from pinned sources, both equal to their pins. `scripts/prepare-embedding-host.mjs
  --build --remap-build-path` built the path-independent engine and the registered
  `ElizaVoiceNative` JNI for both ABIs (receipt checks passed: ELF ABI, embedding symbols, only
  `JNI_OnLoad` exported, 16 KiB alignment); those engine bytes are the voice host record's.
  The Phonon-2 GGUF is the byte-reproducible conversion (`dc552eb7…`, 330,632,256 bytes) of
  `FermionResearch/Phonon-2@7e153e40` made earlier with the pinned converter's `--verify`.
- Voice staging: `node scripts/android-stage-voice-models.mjs --from <outputs>` staged both engines
  and the bundle (Paradee, misaki, eSpeak NG data, Phonon-2, Silero VAD, notices including
  Fermion's NOTICE and the CC-BY-4.0 text) with every byte equal to
  `android/voice-host/qualified-voice-host.json`; `scripts/paradee-runtime.mjs --app-linkage` and
  `scripts/voice-host.mjs --verify` admitted them (`qualified:false`).
- Gradle `--offline -PELIZA_ALLOW_UNPACKAGED_RUNTIME=1 -x :app:verifyEmbeddingHost`, with the
  candidate embedding host libraries (not reviewed) copied into the ignored app `jniLibs`:
  `:app:compileStandaloneDebugJavaWithJavac`, `:app:compileLauncherReleaseJavaWithJavac`,
  `:app:compileStandaloneReleaseJavaWithJavac`, `:app:compile{Standalone,Launcher}DebugAndroidTestJavaWithJavac`
  (including `LiveVoiceVadInstrumentedTest`), `:app:compileStandaloneDebugUnitTestJavaWithJavac`
  and `:sense:compileReleaseJavaWithJavac` BUILD SUCCESSFUL, with `:local-speech:verifySpeechInputs`,
  `:app:verifyParadeeAppLinkage` and `:app:verifyVoiceHost` passing and 29 pinned local-agent
  sources staged (now including `BionicAsrStreams` and `ElizaAsrNativeEnv`).
  `:app:assembleStandaloneDebug` then built a **developer** APK of 413,950,347 bytes (sha256
  `e68ed8f3…`; 1,044,070,938 bytes with the Qwen3 pair at `644d56c93d`): both ABIs carry the
  recorded `libelizainference.so`, `libparadeevoicejni.so` and the candidate app JNI, and
  `assets/paradee-voice/v1` stores (no longer deflates) the GGUFs and lexicon. It has no resident
  runtime payload and skipped the embedding-host admission: build evidence only, not a
  distribution build, never installed or run. The candidate libraries were removed afterwards.
- Live voice (class S): `test/live-voice.test.mjs` (the client against a stub agent speaking the
  upstream wire format, stale-turn and other-session drops, one final per turn, numbers-only latency
  in diagnostics, the host-JVM `LiveVadGate` run) and `test/browser/live-voice.spec.ts` (Chromium,
  stub agent over a routed WebSocket: interim text replaced by each newer partial, cleared at the
  final, nothing in storage) passed. The Chromium voice, speech and timing specs passed (44 of 44), and the production project's
  `native-speech.production.spec.ts` and `production-surface.spec.ts` passed (32 of 32).
  Live voice has not run on an emulator or a device, and interim text does not reach the phone
  (the agent IPC has no event stream; [fused speech](fused-speech.md#live-voice-android-voice-conversation)).
- `npm run verify`: exit 0 at the final content (prepare-client, `tsc --noEmit`, node tests 1238 of
  1238 plus `scripts/test-notes-query-flow.ts`, `npm run build`, `npm run audit:bundle` PASS, 389
  files, `testMocks=false`). The resident dependency audit was re-run at the pin (`vendor/eliza/bun.lock`
  is unchanged, so its findings and dispositions are unchanged).
- Not done: `npm run android:build:local` (the embedding host needs a person to review a receipt at
  this pin), on-device qualification of the voice host, any APK install, instrumentation run,
  emulator HOME-role test, AOSP image, live Eliza Cloud or device acceptance. Evidence classes E, I,
  R and D are absent.

## Pin move to 644d56c93d (2026-10-14): shared voice stack

Branch `claude/mvp-final` (not pushed). alphaphone#493 (`codex/shared-contract-pin-oct14`, not
merged on `main` on 2026-10-14) was merged in and its speech adapters adopted: the shared
paradee-voice library (`:local-speech`, `AlphaParadeeSpeech`, `AlphaLocalSpeechEngine`), the host
Paradee and ASR routes, the registered-JNI embedding contract and its pin `644d56c93d` (elizaOS
develop, containing #36153, #36157, #36158, #36168 and #36194; llama.cpp gitlink `3f131ab9`,
voice ABI 18). elizaOS/eliza#36212 (Phonon-2) merged after this pin, so the ASR slot holds Qwen3-ASR (P-55).
Development machine, load average 25 to 45 from other sessions. No emulator, device or hosted run.

- `npm run upstream:verify`: source verified at `644d56c93d`; reachability re-recorded
  (`develop` reaches the pin, 36 commits behind, 2026-10-14).
- `npm run verify`: exit 0, run again at the final content (prepare-client, `tsc --noEmit`, node tests 1170 of 1170 plus
  `scripts/test-notes-query-flow.ts`, `npm run build`, `npm run audit:bundle` PASS, 389 files,
  `testMocks=false`).
- Voice staging (class B inputs): `node scripts/android-stage-voice-models.mjs --from <build-native output> --from <models>`
  staged both engines and the whole bundle, including the ASR slot pair, with every byte equal to
  `android/voice-host/qualified-voice-host.json`; `node scripts/paradee-runtime.mjs` and
  `node scripts/voice-host.mjs --verify` admitted them (`qualified:false`).
- Gradle `--offline -PELIZA_ALLOW_UNPACKAGED_RUNTIME=1 -x :app:verifyEmbeddingHost`, with the
  voice outputs staged and the candidate embedding host libraries (the voice host engine plus the
  registered `ElizaVoiceNative` JNI; not reviewed) copied into the ignored app `jniLibs`:
  `:app:compile{Standalone,Launcher}DebugAndroidTestJavaWithJavac`,
  `:app:compile{Standalone,Launcher}ReleaseJavaWithJavac` and `:sense:compileReleaseJavaWithJavac`
  BUILD SUCCESSFUL, with `:local-speech:verifySpeechInputs`, `:app:verifyParadeeAppLinkage` and
  `:app:verifyVoiceHost` passing. `:app:assembleStandaloneDebug` then built a **developer** APK
  (1,044,070,938 bytes): both ABIs carry `libelizainference.so` equal to the record,
  `libparadeevoicejni.so` (built by Gradle from the pinned JNI source) and the app JNI, and
  `assets/paradee-voice/v1` carries Paradee, misaki, eSpeak NG data, VAD and the ASR pair. It has
  no resident runtime payload and skipped the embedding-host admission: build evidence only, not
  a distribution build, never installed or run. The candidate libraries were removed afterwards.
- `npm run android:build:local` was not run to completion: its input check passes, and
  `npm run agent:build-embedding-host` stops because the embedding host needs a person (a
  reviewed receipt at this pin; see `android/embedding-host/qualified-host.json`). The input
  report also names the unqualified voice host and the release signer.
- Playwright `chromium`, the 84 speech, voice, audio and transcription spec files: 694 passed,
  2 failed, then fixed (the chat review policy region label) and passed when re-run. The seven
  formerly skipped or fixme Web Speech specs now run through agent speech stubbed at the agent
  boundary (`agentBrowserVoice`): 57 passed.
- Playwright `chromium`, full lane (3,241 tests, 2.1 h at load average 30 to 120): 3,167 passed,
  61 failed, 13 skipped. The 42 failing test locations re-run alone with two workers: 97 passed
  and 3 failed again, none in speech: `accessibility-sweep.spec.ts` launcher Calendar at 200% text
  (the day strip sits under the dock), `gmail-grant-recovery.spec.ts` (expects a sentence that is
  in no source at the previous head, `main` or #493) and the `context-selection.spec.ts` mail
  neighbor switch (the thread chip it clicks is not rendered after `main`'s Gmail conversation
  changes, which arrived through #493). They are recorded as open.
- Playwright `production`: 243 passed, 2 failed (both expected Cloud Notes speech in production);
  updated for on-device Notes speech, then those files passed 51 of 51.
- Resident dependency audit at the pin: the same advisory and version set as at `bc71e21f3b`,
  every finding dispositioned; dispositions carried forward.
- Not run: any instrumented class (LocalSpeech, LocalSpeechBridge, SpeechSentenceCancellation,
  VoiceNoteReadAloud, ResidentAlwaysPresent), on-device voice qualification, an emulator, an AOSP
  image, live Cloud or a device.

## Merge of main into claude/mvp-final (2026-10-13): source, test and compile checks only

Branch `claude/mvp-final` (not pushed) merged `origin/main` at `e4ee4505d` (163 commits, issue work
for #402 to #425, AOSP capability admission, the Contacts adapter, reviewed Files email
attachments, Gradle dependency verification, the strict-build input report). The upstream pin
stays `bc71e21f3b`. Main's product decisions were kept where both sides changed the same behaviour,
with this branch's fixes re-applied on top:

- Calendar availability: main's fail-closed sync-freshness rule now sits in front of the upstream
  `SelectedCalendarReader` as `CalendarSyncFreshness.java` (the Alpha reader it was written for is
  gone at this pin); the JVM reader test covers it.
- Plugin teardown: main's `clockWork` and mail-attachment `work` helpers and the notice-intent
  deduplication now hand work over through `PluginWorkers.submit`; main's scanner counts those
  hand-offs as guarded.
- Browser reading: main's `reading-unsupported` and `reading-not-ready` answers, with this
  branch's stable `sensitive-page` and `isolated-world-unavailable` codes.
- Toasts under dialogs, the floating dock and app titles at large text use main's
  `toast-layer.ts`, dock audit and `alpha-text-xl` rules; this branch's dialog toast mirror and
  `focus-under-composer` rule were dropped as duplicates.
- SBOM and Gradle verification use main's `gradle-verification.mjs` and metadata, with this
  branch's voice-host components and no web-speech or Sherpa components; the strict-build input
  report lists the optional on-device voice bundle in place of the removed Sherpa AAR.
- The explicit native patches (`patches/eliza`) were rebased from `13c9857598` to `bc71e21f3b`
  (`SystemPlugin.kt` applied unchanged; `JsonCredentialSlots.java` keeps the retained-limit
  ceiling of the new pin) and the voice projection guard was re-reviewed at the new pin (inputs
  byte-identical).
- The engine decision recorded on this branch as P-10 is P-42 (main's P-10 is the schedules
  decision).
- Production remote-agent pairing is gone on main, so this branch's flag-off JSON-failure tests
  that paired a remote agent were dropped.

Evidence (class S, plus a Gradle compile), on a development machine at load average 30 to 300
(other sessions running): typecheck passed; the full Node suite ran 930 tests twice, once with 929
passing (the one failure, the 20-second dev-launcher spawn, passed alone) and once with 922 (eight
runner tests hit their spawn timeouts at load 300; all of them, 83 tests in four files, passed when
rerun); the docs, reachability, native-patch admission and secure-store memory tests passed again
after the last edits; `npm run build` and `npm run audit:bundle` passed (387 files, testMocks=false);
`./gradlew --offline -PELIZA_ALLOW_UNPACKAGED_RUNTIME=1` compiled
`:app:compileStandaloneDebugJavaWithJavac`, `:app:compileLauncherDebugJavaWithJavac` and both
`…DebugAndroidTestJavaWithJavac` tasks, BUILD SUCCESSFUL. No APK was assembled or installed, no
emulator, image or device was used, and no Playwright suite was run for the merge.

## Pin move to bc71e21f3b (2026-10-13): source and compile checks only

Branch `claude/mvp-final` (not pushed), upstream pin `bc71e21f3b` (from `13c9857598`), with the
upstream changes consumed as listed in [agent integration](agent-integration.md#upstream-changes-in-the-13c9857598-to-bc71e21f3b-move).
Development machine at load average 60 to 115 (other sessions running). No APK was assembled, no
emulator was started and no workflow was dispatched: nothing here is class B beyond a compile, or
E, I, R or D. The latest emulator record is still round 8, below, at `13c9857598`.

- `npm run upstream:verify`: source verified at `bc71e21f3b`; reachability recorded with
  `--record-reachability` (identical to `develop`, 2026-10-13).
- `npm run verify`: prepare-client and `tsc --noEmit` clean; node tests 818 of 819 passed. The
  one failure, `client-feature-preparation.test.mjs` "direct local development launcher", was its
  20 s spawn timeout under that load; the file passed 6 of 6 when rerun alone. The remaining
  steps were then run one by one: `scripts/test-notes-query-flow.ts` PASS, `npm run build` exit 0,
  `npm run audit:bundle` PASS (387 files, `testMocks=false`). An earlier full node run on the same
  change set before its last test and document fixes passed 815 of 819; the four failures were
  pin statements, a removed evidence path and the Stop test sandbox, all fixed since.
- Playwright `chromium` and `production` projects on the seven spec files the consumed changes
  touch (Stop, Inbox paging, app library, note to calendar hand-off, J04 Android, phone sources
  and dossier, Gmail scope): 62 passed, 0 failed.
- Resident dependency audit (plan step A-3): `node scripts/dependency-audit.mjs --resident --write`
  99 findings, none without a reviewed disposition; `--resident` exits 0
  ([dependency audit](dependency-audit.md)).
- `test/calendar-availability-reader.test.mjs`: the upstream `SelectedCalendarReader`
  availability read on the JVM with the `sqlite3` provider stand-in, PASS.
- Gradle, compile only, against the prepared source at the pin
  (`node scripts/prepare-local-agent.mjs --source-only`):
  `./gradlew --offline -PELIZA_ALLOW_UNPACKAGED_RUNTIME=1` compiled
  `:app:compileStandaloneDebugJavaWithJavac`, `:app:compileLauncherDebugJavaWithJavac` and both
  `…DebugAndroidTestJavaWithJavac` tasks: BUILD SUCCESSFUL. No APK, no install.
- Embedding host: the engine gitlink and `stage-elizavoice-lib.ts` changed, so
  `android/embedding-host/qualified-host.json` is marked for requalification and
  `node scripts/stage-embedding-host.mjs --verify` refuses a distribution build. A candidate was
  built with `node scripts/prepare-embedding-host.mjs --abi arm64-v8a --build` at engine
  `7efee0037524` (NDK 29.0.13113456): ELF ABI, 16 KiB alignment and every embedding and voice
  symbol checked by that script. Its hashes are recorded in the file; it was not reviewed, staged
  or run (class B for the build only).
- Changed instrumented classes, none run: `LauncherAppsInstrumentedTest` (was
  `LauncherLibraryInstrumentedTest`), the lowered-Trash-cap method of
  `NotesStorageDurabilityInstrumentedTest`, the review-text checks of
  `CalendarAgentCrudInstrumentedTest`, and `CalendarAvailabilityInstrumentedTest` on the upstream
  reader.

## MVP completion integration (2026-10-12): source, browser and compile checks only

Branch `claude/mvp-completion` at `bfcd47e2`, upstream pin `13c9857598`: the nine work packages
of the [2026-10-11 audit](mvp-audit-2026-10-11.md) merged ([implementation
results](mvp-audit-2026-10-11.md#implementation-results)). No APK was assembled, no emulator was
started and no workflow was dispatched, so nothing here is class B (beyond a compile), E, I, R
or D. The latest emulator record is still round 8, below.

- `npm run verify` stopped at the since-removed browser speech asset step because that
  engine's runtime package was not installed in the shared `node_modules`. With a
  lockfile-identical `node_modules` that had it: the asset step OK, `tsc --noEmit` clean, the nine node test files that had failed
  for that reason 46 of 46, `scripts/test-notes-query-flow.ts` PASS, `npm run build` exit 0 and
  `npm run audit:bundle` PASS (395 files, `testMocks=false`).
- `npm --ignore-scripts test` at load average 130 to 300: 449 passed, 70 failed. 57 failures
  were spawn timeouts of about 120 s in five native runner suites, which passed 101 of 101
  rerun at `--test-concurrency=2` under lower load; 13 came from the missing in-browser
  speech runtime package (removed since, P-42).
- Playwright `chromium` and `production` projects on the 46 spec files the packages changed:
  972 passed, 6 failed. Two are the mock calendar block clipped at 200% text
  (`accessibility-sweep.spec.ts` and the landscape-200 case; they also fail at `2560eead`), one
  was an `ECONNRESET` in `notes-trash-recovery.spec.ts` that passed 10 of 10 on rerun, and three
  were the J05 Android negatives, fixed in `bfcd47e2`.
- Gradle, compile only: both APK scripts exit 2 at their input check (no speech AAR matches the
  committed digest). With a speech AAR and the prepared resident source supplied only as compile
  inputs, `./gradlew --offline -x :local-speech:preBuild -x :app:verifyEmbeddingHost`
  compiled `:app:compileStandaloneDebugJavaWithJavac`, `:app:compileLauncherDebugJavaWithJavac`
  and both `…DebugAndroidTestJavaWithJavac` tasks: BUILD SUCCESSFUL. No APK, no install.
- New instrumented classes and phases since round 8, none run: `RendererRecovery`,
  `ConnectionRoutes`, `ChatContinuity`, `PasswordVaultSettings`, `PasswordVaultFill`,
  `PosterCalendarJourney`, `JourneyJ05`, `NoteOrigin`, `HomeCalendarCard`, the
  `notes-secure-migration`, `theme`, `crash-log` and source-reference restart phases, the
  account-change method of `WorkflowApprovalNotice` and the approval process-death phase of
  `WorkflowNoticeProcessDeath`. Their commands are in [core loop audit](core-loop-audit.md),
  "What is still not covered". `BrowserFlow`'s default run is now offline; its live search
  needs `--live-network`.
- Not run at this source: `npm run agent:test-digest-restart` (last at `40dbe96bd1`); the new
  dispatch-only lane `.github/workflows/digest-restart.yml` was not dispatched.

## Round 10 (2026-10-11): native teardown, live search and reading availability, none run

Branch `claude/r10-native-robustness`. Source, compile and browser checks only (class S). No
APK was assembled, no emulator was started and no workflow was dispatched, so nothing here is
class B or class E evidence, and no fix below has been shown to hold on Android.

- **Calls that arrive after a plugin is destroyed.** Round 8 fixed one plugin
  (`AlphaDevicePlugin`) after a `RejectedExecutionException` on Capacitor's bridge thread killed
  the process. Every Java source under `android/app/src/main/java` was read for the same class.
  Found and changed: `AlphaMailAttachmentsPlugin` (`readSelected`, `openReviewed`,
  `retainSourceReference`, `openSourceReference` handed work to the stopped worker with no
  catch) and `AlphaActionJournalPlugin` (`reviewClock`, `confirmClock` used the shared plugin's
  worker, which that plugin stops on destroy); both now reject the call. `BrowserDownloads`
  handed work to two workers that `destroy()` stops and showed its dialogs from completions
  posted by those workers; after `destroy()` it now shows nothing and drops the work.
  `AlphaBrowserPlugin` accepted `create`, `downloads` and the other main-thread methods after
  destroy (its session is cleared then, so `create` built a WebView on the dead activity and
  `downloads` opened a dialog on it); every such call is now rejected as "Browser closed".
  Two smaller ones: `AlphaDevicePlugin.setTextScale` also refuses a destroyed activity, and
  `AlphaHostedResultsPlugin.enable` rejects when Android has no channel-settings page instead
  of throwing on the bridge thread. Already answering a stopped worker before this round:
  `AlphaDevicePlugin` (problem log), `AlphaHostedResultsPlugin`, `AlphaNotificationsPlugin`,
  `AlphaMapsTransportPlugin`, `AlphaVoiceCloudPlugin`, `AlphaLocalAgentPlugin`,
  `AlphaConnectionPlugin`, `AlphaFilesPlugin`, `AlphaNoteDocumentsPlugin`,
  `AlphaNoteAudioPlugin`, `AlphaPhotosPlugin`. Receivers and callbacks (`DeviceAppsPlugin`,
  the browser's autofill callback and WebView listener, the voice plugin's memory callbacks,
  the Maps stop listener) were already released on destroy. `test/native-plugin-teardown.test.mjs`
  scans every source for an executor hand-off outside a `try` that answers the rejection, and
  it fails on the pre-change sources at the eight places named above. It is a source-shape
  guard: no late call was delivered to a destroyed plugin on a device. Three hand-offs are
  listed in the test as reviewed exceptions with the reason for each.
- **Requests that launch through the activity** (found in review of this branch; same class,
  not an executor). A permission request or an activity-result request has no launcher once
  the activity is destroyed: androidx unregisters it then and `launch()` throws
  `IllegalStateException`, on Capacitor's bridge thread (read from the `androidx.activity`
  1.10.1 classes this build resolves; not reproduced on a device). Unguarded before:
  `AlphaHostedResultsPlugin.enable`, `AlphaVoiceCloudPlugin.startRecording`,
  `DailyAppsPlugin.perform` (a selection), Capacitor's own `requestPermissions` on the four
  plugins that declare permissions (the startup access panel calls it on `DailyApps` and
  `AlphaVoiceCloud`), and three plugin methods the app's plugins inherit from shared ones
  (`CalendarPlugin.requestAccess`, `requestWorkflowReadAccess`, `ReminderPlugin.scheduleReminder`).
  Each is now the body of `LateLaunch.ask`, which rejects the call; the inherited ones are
  overridden in the app's subclass, and the shared sources are unchanged. The guard test scans
  every app source for such a request outside `LateLaunch.ask` or a `try` that answers it, and
  reads the shared parent classes so a new inherited request needs its override. **Not
  covered:** the shared camera and location plugins, which the app registers without
  subclassing, make the same permission requests unguarded (`vendor/eliza/plugins`); that
  needs an upstream change, not an edit here. Also changed: `AlphaMapsTransportPlugin.startNavigation`
  refuses after destroy and retires a session it started while destruction ran, so a late
  call cannot leave a navigation notification with no renderer behind it; and the native
  reading review now gives the unavailable answer before it asks for a speech route.
- **BrowserFlow live search** (failed in rounds 7 and 8). The product request is correct:
  search words become `https://www.google.com/search?q=<words>`. The saved result files
  (`f-default/*/BrowserFlow.txt`) show a complete HTTPS page with a body that was not that
  address, and deliberately carry no URL, so which page loaded was **not observed**. The
  likely cause, not confirmed, is Google answering the emulator's network with its own check
  page (`www.google.com/sorry/…`) or consent page (`consent.google.com`), both of which carry
  the interrupted search in `continue`. The method now accepts either the results page as
  before, or one of those two pages when it is HTTPS, on that host, and `continue` is this
  exact search; and in both cases it asserts the product's own request from the page's history
  entry (HTTPS, `www.google.com`, `/search`, `q` equal to the typed words) and the missing
  bridge. A pass records `INSTRUMENTATION_STATUS: browserFlowSearch=results` or
  `=provider-check`, so a campaign can say which it saw; a pass with `provider-check` is not
  evidence that a results page renders. Any other page still fails, now with the host and path
  class of what loaded. If the next campaign fails with `host: other`, the hypothesis is wrong
  and the method needs another look; a failure that reports `www.google.com`, `/search` and a
  short `textLength` would instead mean the results address answered with a page that never
  filled in (a script check that did not complete), which this method does not accept. Not run.
- **Page reading without isolated-world injection** (WebView 133 on the SDK emulator).
  Nothing was injected into a page's own world before this round and nothing is now; the
  refusal was a toast after a speech route had been prepared, with advice to reload that could
  not help. Now `AlphaBrowser.readingSupport` reports the provider's capability, the browser
  menu carries a note when it is absent, Read aloud and Ask about page say so before doing
  anything else, and the native review refuses with the same sentence (code
  `reading-unsupported`), separately from a page that is merely not ready. The wording is an
  engineering default. `BrowserReadingNavigationInstrumentedTest` has two methods and exactly
  one runs on a given provider: the stale-document method (its assertions unchanged) with the
  capability, and `providerWithoutIsolatedWorldSaysReadingIsUnavailableAndInjectsNothing`
  without it. The other is skipped by assumption and listed as such; the class no longer
  proves stale-document rejection by passing, so read the `ignored` list or
  `browserReadingProvider=isolated-world|no-isolated-world`. Not run.
- Compiled (JDK 21, `--offline`, `npm run agent:prepare -- --source-only`, staged agent
  sources, a locally built unqualified speech AAR as a compile input):
  `./gradlew :app:compileStandaloneDebugJavaWithJavac :app:compileLauncherDebugJavaWithJavac
  :app:compileStandaloneDebugAndroidTestJavaWithJavac :app:compileLauncherDebugAndroidTestJavaWithJavac
  -x :local-speech:preBuild -x :app:stageLocalAgentSources -PELIZA_ALLOW_UNPACKAGED_RUNTIME=1`
  with `-PELIZA_DEV_ALLOW_TEST_MOCKS=0` and again with `=1`: BUILD SUCCESSFUL both times.
  Compilation only.
- Run on a development machine at the reviewed source (after the review additions above; the
  Gradle compile was repeated then too): `npm run verify` exit 0 (695 tests, 691 passed,
  0 failed, 4 todo; bundle audit passed, 395 files, `testMocks=false`);
  `ALPHA_BROWSER_TEST_PORT=7053 npx playwright test --project=chromium --workers=4` on
  `reading-capability`, `browser-navigation`, `reading-review`, `reading-source`,
  `reading-sensitive`, `journey-e-browser-credentials`, `web-summary-note` and
  `browser-signins`: 67 passed. The Chromium specs run the web build, which never asks the
  native capability question; the production project was not run.
- Emulator commands for the integrator (developer APKs; class E when run), with
  `RUN` = `npm run test:android:instrumentation -- --owned-emulator --avd <avd> --serial emulator-NNNN`:
  `RUN --classes BrowserFlow,BrowserReadingNavigation,BrowserSignins,BrowserContinuity,MailAttachment,ClockHandoff`
  (network needed for BrowserFlow); `RUN --test-mocks --classes BrowserDownload,BrowserFlow,BrowserDialogLifecycle,BrowserWebFeatures`;
  `RUN --variants launcher --home-role --classes SettingsRoles,LauncherHome`, repeated, since
  the crash it found appeared once in 22 runs; and, for the plugin methods now routed through
  `LateLaunch`, `RUN --classes DailyApps,ReminderLifecycle,HostedResultsLifecycle,StartupReadiness`
  with the voice permission campaigns of `scripts/test-native-permissions.mjs`. These exercise
  the changed plugins while the activity is alive, and LauncherHome destroys it; none delivers
  a call to a destroyed plugin on purpose, so a pass is regression evidence only.

## Round 10 (2026-10-11): approval notices across process death and owner change, not run

Class S only. Nothing in this section ran on an emulator or a device, and no APK was built.

- Product change: when a different owner connects, the renderer asks the native ledger to
  withdraw the approval notices posted for any other owner
  (`AlphaHostedResults.withdrawOtherOwnerApprovalNotices`, only the owner ID crosses the
  bridge; `WorkflowNoticeDelivery.withdrawOtherOwners`). The notice is cancelled, its tap route
  is released and its receipt stays `withdrawn` in the shared upstream ledger (`NoticeDelivery`)
  until the approval expires, so it is never posted again. Step (result) notices are not
  touched. This is an engineering default, not an owner decision
  ([owner actions](mvp-owner-actions.md), decision 18). Before this change the notice stayed in
  the shade and its tap answered "Connect its original agent".
- `scripts/android-workflow-native.mjs` has a third phase, `approval-notice-recovery`, two
  cases on each distribution (18 cases in all):
  `WorkflowApprovalNoticeProcessDeathInstrumentedTest` under the instrumentation APK's
  `WorkflowNoticeProcessRunner` (the test runs in a helper process of the app and kills the
  main process), and
  `WorkflowApprovalNoticeInstrumentedTest#ownerChangeWithdrawsThePendingApprovalNoticeAndItsTapOpensNothing`.
  Each case runs in its own disposable user from the hash-admitted archive pair, records the
  pair and its runner, and a failed, skipped or missing case stops the campaign and exits
  non-zero. `scripts/android-instrumentation.mjs` names the process-death class as a campaign
  class; `--classes WorkflowApprovalNotice` now runs three methods, two of which post.
- What the process-death case asserts: one receipt and one route before the death; after the
  main process is killed and proven absent, the same OS notice (key, post time, PendingIntent)
  and byte-identical ledgers; the tap starts a new main process whose plugin captures the
  original token with the exact approval ID, binding and route; the capture rewrites no receipt;
  a repeated request posts nothing and rewrites neither ledger; a changed binding or expiry is
  refused. Not covered: the renderer's authenticated read after the capture (the fixture has
  no agent), a decision made after the restart, reboot, and force-stop.
- Source checks run: `test/workflow-approval-notice.test.mjs` (JVM contract of the withdrawal:
  both ledgers, a captured tap of the old owner, a storage fault, invalid owners),
  `test/native-campaign-evidence.test.mjs` (the real runner against a synthetic `adb`: runner
  component, gates, grants, report, selection, failure propagation),
  `test/android-instrumentation-runner.test.mjs`, and
  `test/browser/workflow-notice-taps.spec.ts` (the renderer sends exactly the connected owner's
  ID once, repeats a failed request, and in the `owner-change` scenario asks again with the next
  owner's ID after a different owner connects, whose session never opens the first owner's
  retained tap). The touched Java (three main and three androidTest
  files) was compiled with `javac` against the SDK 36 `android.jar`, Capacitor's sources and the
  Gradle cache's dependency jars with stub `R` and `BuildConfig` classes; the errors that
  remained were all in untouched files that need generated or unstaged inputs. It was not
  compiled by Gradle and no lint ran.
- Review follow-up (same date): the renderer now reads an approval notice's route when the
  request is queued, not when the queue reaches it (`queueApprovalNotices` in
  `workflow-adapter.ts`). A request that waited behind an earlier one while the owner changed
  used to take the next owner's identity, so its notice would have been posted for that owner
  and kept by the withdrawal; a decision's withdrawal likewise keeps the route of the session
  that made it. No browser spec drives the renderer's approval post or withdrawal calls (the
  phone-step specs run without a native platform), so this is covered by the type check only.
  The owner-change instrumented case also refuses to start with an approval route left by an
  earlier test and releases its own routes when it fails.
- Ledger check (MVP-12): the inventory still said no runner grants the Calendar permissions to
  `CalendarAvailabilityInstrumentedTest`. `scripts/test-calendar-regression.mjs` has done so
  since round 8 and the class passed on both flavors in the run recorded below; the entry was
  corrected.

## Round 10 (2026-10-11): the strict build chain at pin `13c98575987a`, on a development machine

Build evidence only, from one macOS arm64 development machine at product source `2560eead`
plus this round's changes. Nothing was installed or run on an emulator or device, no
workflow was dispatched, and **no APK from these runs is distributable or was kept**: two
inputs were local substitutes, as named below. Raw logs were not committed.

What the strict chain (`npm run android:build:local`, no override) needs, and where it
stops on a clean checkout:

| Order | Input | Supplied by | State on a clean checkout |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Pinned `vendor/eliza` | script (`git submodule update`) | present |
| 2 | Speech AAR matching `runtime-manifest.json` | the reviewed AAR: a person (A-24, MVP-23). A local rebuild: scripts, with `--allow-unqualified-runtime` | missing; the preflight exits 2 here |
| 3 | Reviewed ARM64 embedding host libraries | a person (see below) | missing; `agent:build-embedding-host` exits 3 here |
| 4 | Prepared runtime source | script (`agent:prepare`) | produced |
| 5 | Workflow worker artifact | script (`agent:build-workflow-worker`) | produced |
| 6 | Staged runtime payload and embedding model | script (`agent:stage-android`) | produced |
| 7 | Notices listing the packaged runtime | script (`licenses:packaged-runtime`, new in the chain) | produced |
| 8 | Gradle verification metadata | committed | present |
| 9 | Release signer and signing values | a person (A-06) | unset; the build completes unsigned |

The first input that needs a person is the qualified speech AAR (step 2). With a locally
built, unqualified speech runtime in place, the first step that stops is the embedding
host (step 3), and it is the only one of the three that stops the chain: unqualified speech
and an unset signer leave it running and make its releases `distributable:false`.

The embedding host. `qualified-host.json` names three libraries by SHA-256; they are not in
Git and were not found on this machine. Rebuilt here from the pinned engine
(`elizaOS/llama.cpp` at `ea8b3f2d`, the gitlink of the pin) with NDK `29.0.13113456` and
CMake 4.0.3: `libc++_shared.so` matched the reviewed bytes exactly (which identifies the
NDK), `libelizainference.so` came out at 6,208,400 bytes against the reviewed 6,199,248
and `libelizavoicejni.so` at 1,016,632 against 1,016,376. The rebuilt libraries contain the
absolute build directory (183 source paths in the first, 5 in the second), and the size
differences (9,152 and 256 bytes) are about 50 bytes per embedded path, which is what a
shorter build directory would give. The
reviewed build's directory is recorded only in its receipt, which is not in the
repository, so no script can reproduce those bytes. With the new
`prepare-embedding-host.mjs --remap-build-path`, two builds in different directories were
byte-identical to each other (6,187,152 and 1,009,560 bytes; hashes in
`android/embedding-host/build-toolchain.json` under `unqualifiedCandidateMeasurement`).
Those bytes are not reviewed, not qualified and not staged by any script.

How far the chain got. With an unqualified speech runtime copied from an earlier round's
worktree and, for this run only, the unreviewed local rebuild admitted through an
uncommitted edit of `qualified-host.json` (both reverted afterwards):

- `npm run agent:prepare`, `npm run agent:build-workflow-worker` and
  `npm run agent:stage-android` each exited 0 at the pin.
- `npm run android:deps:write-verification` ran the ten tasks of `VERIFIED_TASKS` with
  `-PELIZA_ALLOW_UNPACKAGED_RUNTIME=0`: `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`, 1,276 tasks executed.
- `npm run android:build` with no option then exited 0 twice with dependency verification
  enforced. Both flavors: debug and unsigned release APKs, both instrumentation APKs, lint,
  and `verify-apks` with the resident runtime `PACKAGED` (1,120 verified entries per
  release, 1,121 per debug APK, upstream commit `13c98575987a`), bundle audit passed.
- The first of those two runs recorded the releases not distributable for five reasons. One
  was a chain defect: "notices lack the packaged runtime", because nothing in
  `android:build:local` ran `generate-licenses.mjs --packaged-runtime` (the hosted
  resident job does). With that step added (660 entries, 66 flagged, exit 0) the second
  run recorded `runtimeNotices: true` and four reasons, all of which need a person: speech
  native bytes not admitted, speech functional acceptance pending or failed, unsigned
  release, release signer unset.
- The build wrote `artifacts/sbom/alphaphone.cdx.json` (1,878 components: 71 Gradle
  coordinates with checksums, 1,154 staged files, Bun, 550 bundled packages, 4 APKs).

Afterwards, on the restored checkout, `npm run android:build:local` exited 3 at
`agent:build-embedding-host` in under a second with the message naming who is needed, and
with the speech AAR removed the preflight exited 2 before it.

Not done and not claimed: a strict build with the reviewed embedding host and a qualified
speech runtime; any signed release; any Linux or hosted build with the verification
metadata; any install. `resident-android.yml` (dispatch-only) stages no embedding host and
so cannot pass `:app:verifyEmbeddingHost` either; it was not changed or dispatched.

Review of this package (2026-10-11, same machine; source tests and two offline Gradle
configuration runs, no APK task, no native build, nothing installed):

- The repository review had read only the two root Gradle scripts while stating that "the
  build" declares three repositories. The fifteen included projects have build scripts of
  their own, and five of them name a repository by URL (Maven Central in four upstream
  plugins, the plugin portal in Capacitor). The check now reads every included script and
  the documents say what is declared
  ([dependency audit](dependency-audit.md#gradle-dependency-verification)).
- The instruction printed for the embedding host did not work as written on a clean
  checkout: `stage-embedding-host.mjs --receipt` reads the staged embedding model, which
  only `agent:stage-android` stages and which the chain reaches after the step that stops;
  and it refuses to replace a differing `qualified-host.json`. The message, the README and
  the owner action now say both, and the staging command names the missing model instead
  of failing on a missing file.
- "Rebuilds and stages the libraries on any machine" was more than was measured (three
  directories on one macOS arm64 host). The wording now says that, and that a rebuild is
  staged only when it is byte-identical.
- The step's rebuild-and-stage path (taken only once `remapBuildPath` is true) had no test.
  It now has one with the compile step replaced: an exact reproduction is staged, any
  difference stages nothing and exits 3, `--status` and `--candidate` never stage.
- Two assertions would have failed on the day a person supplied an input (a release host
  with signing values set; the commit that qualifies a remapped host). They now follow the
  committed records.
- The recorded checksums were compared with the origin: the 71 shipped coordinates and the
  three `aapt2` archives were fetched again from Google's Maven repository and Maven Central
  and matched. `android/gradle/verification-metadata.xml` is now part of the build-input
  snapshot (`scripts/source-snapshot.mjs`), and the check accepts one checksum per artifact.
- Gradle was run twice, offline, to see the metadata refuse: with the Android Gradle plugin
  jar's checksum changed `./gradlew help` failed on dependency verification (the file was
  restored). `:app:dependencies` does not verify, because it resolves no artifact. No APK
  task was run in review.
- The embedding host and model entries of the SBOM said `ships-in: apk` in every document,
  including the one written beside the foundation job's unpackaged APKs, which contain
  neither. They now say an APK that packages the resident runtime.
- Still open, unchanged by review: no Linux or hosted build has run with the metadata.

## Round 8 (2026-10-11): runner cases, fixes and hosted jobs, none run

Branch `claude/r8-runner-ci`. This section records source, compile and host-runtime checks
only. No APK was assembled, no emulator was started and no workflow was dispatched, so
nothing below is class B or class E evidence. When this section was written the round 7
results were the latest emulator results; the integration of this branch then ran part of
the campaign, recorded under "Emulator results at 2961bd9e" further down, which is where
each fix named here is shown to hold, to fail or to be still unrun.

- Compiled (JDK 21, `--offline`, staged agent sources, the speech AAR used as a compile
  input): `./gradlew :app:compileStandaloneDebugJavaWithJavac :app:compileLauncherDebugJavaWithJavac
  :app:compileStandaloneDebugAndroidTestJavaWithJavac :app:compileLauncherDebugAndroidTestJavaWithJavac
  -x :local-speech:preBuild -x :app:stageLocalAgentSources -PELIZA_ALLOW_UNPACKAGED_RUNTIME=1`
  with `-PELIZA_DEV_ALLOW_TEST_MOCKS=0` and again with `=1`: BUILD SUCCESSFUL both times.
- CalendarTruncation (failed in round 7, "not triaged"): product defect. `AlphaCalendar.list`
  had returned every instance with `truncated:false` since the shared calendar plugin was
  adopted (`ab780d04`), so the documented 2,000-instance bound no longer existed and the
  warning the test waits for could not appear. `AlphaCalendarPlugin.list` reads through
  `CalendarRangeReader` again. `test/calendar-range-reader.test.mjs` runs that reader on the
  JVM against a stand-in provider (2,000 returned whole, 2,001 reported incomplete, reading
  stops at the first row past the bound). The instrumentation is unchanged and not rerun.
- PasswordBrowserFill, `test-native-restart.mjs notes` and FilesTree (each failed once or
  twice in round 7, "cause not established"): each has a cause read from the saved result
  files and the source, and a fix. The causes, the fixes and the repeat commands that would
  show them hold are in the [core loop audit](core-loop-audit.md), "Repeat runs for the round 7
  failures". One of them changes the product: a document receipt in Notes now waits until the
  page is visible (`test/browser/notes-document-receipt.spec.ts`).
- Runner cases, checked against the synthetic `adb` fixtures only:
  `scripts/test-calendar-regression.mjs` runs `directSaveReadsBackAllDayChosenZoneAndRrule`
  with `calendarOptions=1` and the whole `CalendarAvailabilityInstrumentedTest`;
  `scripts/developer-archive.mjs` assembles the archive `scripts/android-workflow-native.mjs`
  reads from a verify-apks developer build, and that campaign accepts `--variant=` and
  `--phase=`; BrowserDownload left the default class list, because on a build without test
  mocks it can only be skipped and a skipped class fails the run.
- Hosted jobs, linted with `actionlint` and checked by `test/ci-emulator-evidence.test.mjs`,
  never dispatched: `.github/workflows/android-emulator.yml`
  ([CI cost policy](ci-cost-policy.md#emulator-evidence-android-emulatoryml)).
- Host-runtime evidence, not Android: `npm run agent:test-digest-restart` at pin `40dbe96bd1`
  (the pin of this branch before it was merged with round 9, which moved the pin to
  `13c9857598`; not repeated there), exit 0, one run ([record](local-agent-development.md#isolated-digest-process-recovery-check)).
- Source and browser checks on this branch (class S): `npm run verify` exit 0 at `ce8488f2` (672 tests, 668
  passed, 0 failed, 4 todo; bundle audit passed, 395 files, `testMocks=false`);
  `ALPHA_BROWSER_TEST_PORT=6912 npm run test:browser:production` 175 passed; the Chromium
  project for the Notes specs this round touches (`notes-document-receipt`, `mvp`,
  `notes-document-storage`, `notes-save-failure`, `notes-status-layout`, `notes-trash`,
  `journey-b-voice-note-actions`, `journey-j03-document-analysis`) 51 passed.
- Review of this branch (2026-10-10; the same evidence classes, no emulator and no dispatch).
  Two changes. The Notes failure notice ("Document operation failed. No completed export or
  import is confirmed.") was still issued at once, so a failure that returned while the
  system picker covered the app could be over before anyone saw it, the race the receipts
  had; it now waits for the document to be visible too, and
  `test/browser/notes-document-receipt.spec.ts` has that case (it fails without the change).
  The four third-party actions the older workflows named by major tag are pinned to the
  commits those tags resolved to (`git ls-remote`, 2026-10-10: `android-actions/setup-android`
  v3 = v3.2.2 `9fc6c4e9`, `gradle/actions/setup-gradle` v4 = v4.4.3 `ed408507`,
  `reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner` v2 = v2.38.0 `a421e438`, `oven-sh/setup-bun` v2 =
  v2.2.0 `0c5077e5`), which are the commits `android-emulator.yml` already named, and
  `test/ci-emulator-evidence.test.mjs` now requires a commit in every workflow file.
  Checks on the reviewed tree: `npm run verify` exit 0 (673 tests, 669 passed, 0 failed, 4
  todo; bundle audit passed, 395 files, `testMocks=false`);
  `ALPHA_BROWSER_TEST_PORT=6932 npm run test:browser:production` 175 passed; the same eight
  Chromium Notes specs 52 passed; `actionlint` exit 0 on the seven workflow files; the Gradle
  compile above repeated for both flavors, app and androidTest, with test mocks off and on:
  BUILD SUCCESSFUL twice (compile only, no APK). The digest restart check was not repeated.

## Round 10 (2026-10-11): accessibility gaps (MVP-48), source and browser tests only

Class S throughout: source, Node tests and Chromium on a development server or the flag-off
bundle. No emulator, device, APK or hosted job was used; the emulator rows below are unchanged
history and none of this is evidence for them. Branch `claude/r10-a11y-gaps`, from `2560eead`.

| Finding | What changed | Covered by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Home's last row under the floating composer at 200% text (emulator, standalone flavor) | Home and the app library end above the dock; the dock's footprint is measured (`runtime/dock-clearance.ts`), 108px stays the minimum | `accessibility-resilience.spec.ts` (both shells at 100%, 150% and 200%, a raised dock, a longer draft, a stacked status line, landscape); rule `obscured-by-dock` in every lane of the sweep |
| A focused control partly under the composer | Focus that did not come from a pointer is scrolled wholly above the dock; app scrollers carry the dock's footprint as scroll padding | rule `focus-obscured` in the tab-order walk of every lane, now also walked at 200%; the Settings focus tests |
| Titles shortened at 200% (Photos, Camera, Password manager; the Home calendar title cut by its clamp) | Above 150% text a screen title takes a row of its own; the Home title's line height opens with the text scale | the title tests in `accessibility-resilience.spec.ts`; no `[data-alpha-app-title]` or `.home-calendar-title` truncation is left in the 200% lane |
| A toast under a top-layer dialog was neither seen nor announced | The topmost modal dialog gets a live region of its own, drawn above it (`runtime/toast-layer.ts`) | rules `toast-not-announced` and `toast-covered`; the dialog toast tests (position, hit test, accessibility tree, Undo, cleanup) |
| Landscape with 200% text was not swept | A lane of its own. It needed one fix, caused by the title row: in landscape the camera's capture rail starts below that row and the camera's message stops at the rail | `accessibility-sweep.spec.ts` |
| Provider-connected states were not swept | Ten states against a synthetic mailbox at the provider boundary. They found two defects, fixed: the email message field ran 16px under the pill, and a connection's status was cut off at 200% text in Settings | `accessibility-sweep.spec.ts`, `test/accessibility-coverage.test.mjs` |
| Launcher flavor: "an accessibility click reaches no page control on this WebView" | Test defect, not a product one; see below | `test/accessibility-stand-in.test.mjs` (source checks only) |

Each new rule is shown to fire on a seeded defect and to stay quiet on corrected markup in
`accessibility-audit.spec.ts`. With the Home rule, the scroll padding and the focus handler
taken out, the Home tests at 200% and the Settings focus test at 100% failed, so they do
detect the defects.

**The dropped accessibility click.** The round 8 result files show `ACTION_CLICK` accepted
on the handle, on an app tile and on the calendar card with no click arriving and focus
staying on the page body, while `ACTION_FOCUS` on the same node did move focus. The cause was
found by reading Chromium source at the image's WebView version (133.0.6943.137), not by a
run:

- `WebContentsAccessibilityImpl.performAction` calls native `Click` and returns `true`
  whatever happens next.
- `BrowserAccessibilityManager::DoDefaultAction` returns without sending anything when the
  node has no default action verb (`BrowserAccessibility::HasDefaultAction`). `SetFocus` has
  no such gate.
- Blink writes the default action verb in `AXObject::SerializeOtherScreenReaderAttributes`,
  which runs only in the screen reader accessibility mode.
- On Android that mode is chosen from `AccessibilityManager.getEnabledAccessibilityServiceList`
  (`AccessibilityState.updateAccessibilityServices`; `SetBrowserAXMode` falls back to the basic
  mode when no listed service looks like a screen reader). UiAutomation is not in that list,
  and the image has no TalkBack.

So on that image WebView was in its reduced mode and dropped every default action; with
TalkBack or Switch Access bound it would not. The product side was checked in Chromium: the
handle is a named, enabled button with no disabled or read-only ancestor in the
accessibility tree, and the event sequence an accessibility click produces (pointerdown,
mousedown, pointerup, mouseup, click on the element) opens the panel in both shells.
`AccessibilityInstrumentedTest` now binds a stand-in screen reader from the instrumentation
APK for that step (`ScreenReaderStandInService`: every event type, spoken feedback, no touch
exploration), connects UiAutomation without suspending other services, requires the click to
open the panel, then requires a single further click to open it again, and restores the two
settings it changes. The click is repeated once a second for at most 20 seconds only while
WebView is still switching modes, because nothing visible to a test says when it has. The
check that the panel reads in order moved to the pull-down step, so it runs in the same
WebView mode as before. None of this has run: the diagnosis is from source and the changed
test is compiled only (`javac` 21 against `android-36`, the Gradle cache's dependency jars
and the app classes of an existing build; no Gradle build, lint or APK).

Run for this branch (class S): `npm run verify` exit 0 (684 Node tests: 680 pass, 0 fail, 4
todo; bundle audit `PASS web-dist`). The Chromium project, every spec file, in nine batches
with four workers: 3099 passed, 12 skipped, 1 failed. The failure is
`local-agent-native-stream.spec.ts` "retained navigation waits for native stream settlement:
ready-failure"; it fails 4 of 4 with the app source of `2560eead` as well and was not
changed here. Two tests for the product side of the accessibility click were added after
that run and passed with their spec (`accessibility-audit` and `accessibility-resilience`
together: 60 passed). In the production project `accessibility-sweep.production.spec.ts` (now with the
dock rules), `production-surface`, `settings`, `home-attention`, `home-daily-overview` and
`journey-core-loops`: 119 passed; the rest of that project was not run.

Open after this round: an emulator run of Accessibility on both flavors (the Home change and
the stand-in step are unproven there; if the click still does not arrive with the stand-in
bound, the failure message now carries the attempts, the running services and the enabled
state of the node and its ancestors); TextScale and Rotation; everything in MVP-48's device
list. Not swept: the launcher presentation of the app views, zoom above 200%, connected
states other than a mailbox. An app page's own content still scrolls under the composer by
design; only Home and the app library end above it.

## Emulator results at 69a4be6c (2026-10-14, system shade #416 #417)

Class E only (emulator instrumentation), for these exact APKs. Not distributable-build, AOSP
image, Pixel 10a, real TalkBack, real-integration or user acceptance, and not evidence for any
later source. The result files under `test-results/` are not committed.

- Source: `69a4be6c` (branch `claude/issue-417-shade-instrumented`, on `main` at `8aa3e3e8`,
  upstream pin `13c98575987a`). Its two commits change instrumented test source and the runner
  registry only; no product source changed. The first runs below were at `8aa3e3e8` and at the
  intermediate `5edd0b6e`, as stated in their rows.
- APKs: **developer builds, never distributable**: `npm run agent:prepare -- --source-only`,
  then `ALPHA_ANDROID_LOW_DISK=1 npm run android:build -- --allow-unpackaged-runtime`, with and
  without `--test-mocks`, resident runtime not packaged, with the unqualified local speech AAR
  `528507c0…` and a developer-override `runtime-manifest.json` (the
  `baselines/qualified-runtime-manifest-before-20261008.json` record), not committed, so every
  result file says `dirty: true`. Test-mocks app / instrumentation: standalone `06ccecd5…` /
  `d73adc1d…`, launcher `3b3696ea…` / `066438b1…`. Production (flag off) app / instrumentation:
  standalone `21151086…` / `170f012c…`, launcher `a50c2f57…` / `063d9e9c…`.
- Emulator: AVD `Pixel_API_35` started read-only for this run on serial `emulator-5600` and shut
  down afterwards, `system-images;android-35-ext15;google_apis;arm64-v8a`
  (`google/sdk_gphone64_arm64/emu64a:15/AE3A.240806.046.B2/13139635:userdebug`), WebView
  `com.google.android.webview` 124.0.6367.219, stock HOME `com.google.android.apps.nexuslauncher`
  read back after every HOME change; no Alpha package left installed. Host load average 40 to 150.

| Run | Result | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SystemShade, Notifications on the production pair at `8aa3e3e8` | standalone SystemShade passed (3 of 3), launcher SystemShade failed 1 of 3, Notifications failed 2 of 2 on both flavors | Test defect (environment of the class). A production Android build opens the Eliza Cloud sign-in gate over Home; it cannot be passed without an account and `AppNavigation` has no offline choice there. Notifications timed out waiting for the panel to go. SystemShade's launcher button request returned `opened` and Android's shade was observed, but the empty-Home pull landed on the panel; the standalone pass was vacuous for the same reason. Now: Notifications is a test-mocks class (the runner refuses it otherwise), SystemShade's Home method is skipped by assumption on a flag-off build and waits for Home with no connection panel over it. |
| SystemShade, Notifications on the test-mocks pair at `8aa3e3e8` | SystemShade passed on both flavors; Notifications: `actualNotificationsAppearAndOpenInAndroidsShade` passed, `goneTargetNeverDispatchesOrOpensItsNeighbor` failed ("The neighbor remains posted"), both flavors | Test defect. Android 15 bundles the two notices into an automatic group (`ranker_group`), shown collapsed in the shade. `AndroidShade.tap` clicked the first clickable ancestor of the title, the group's summary row: nothing was dispatched and both notices were cancelled. The tap now clicks only the notice's own `expandableNotificationRow`, expanding a collapsed group first (`5edd0b6e`). What a person's tap on a collapsed group's summary does with Alpha's own notices is a product question this run did not change. |
| SystemShade with the launcher selected as HOME, `5edd0b6e` | 2 of 3 runs passed; one failed "A pull with the composer focused does not open Android's shade" | Test defect, found with a page probe. In 18 runs of diagnostic test builds (not recorded) the composer-focused swipe, made right after the shade collapsed, never reached the page (no `touchstart`) and Alpha made no `openNotificationShade` request; in 2 of them Android reopened its own shade. The same probe recorded the empty-Home pull reaching the page and making one request. SystemUI's collapsing shade window still took the touch. When the assertion passed it was vacuous. Each pull is now retried until a touch reaches Alpha's Home, and the page counts Alpha's requests: one for the empty-Home pull, none with the composer focused (focus checked at the touch) and none on standalone (`69a4be6c`). |
| `npm run test:android:instrumentation -- --test-mocks --classes SystemShade,Notifications,Accessibility`, `69a4be6c` | **passed**, both flavors: SystemShade 3 of 3, Notifications 2 of 2, Accessibility 1 of 1 per flavor (12 of 12 tests) | Covers: the outcome mapping including `permission-missing` and `unsupported`; EXPAND_STATUS_BAR declared and held by the launcher only; the launcher request returns `opened` and Android's shade opens, standalone returns `standalone` and it does not; an empty-Home pull reaches Home, makes one request and opens Android's shade with no Alpha panel; a composer-focused pull makes none; posted notices are tapped in Android's shade and fire their PendingIntents; a cancelled target dispatches nothing and does not dispatch or remove its neighbour; a top-edge swipe opens Android's shade with no Alpha panel; the accessibility click action (UiAutomation, not TalkBack) and a pull from the button open it; standalone has no button. Home fit the screen (`data-alpha-home-fits="true"`) in every pull, so the overflowing-Home path was not exercised. |
| The same launcher test-mocks pair with Alpha selected as HOME (`cmd role add-role-holder`, HOME key, `am instrument` per class), `69a4be6c` | SystemShade 5 of 5 runs passed (3 tests each), Notifications 5 of 5 (2 tests each) | Run by hand, not through the runner's `--home-role` phase (neither class is a HOME-role class there); the original HOME holder was restored and read back. |
| `npm run test:android:instrumentation -- --classes SystemShade` on the production pair, `69a4be6c` | passed, both flavors: 2 of 3 run, `homeAsksAndroidForItsShadeOnTheLauncherOnly` skipped by assumption | The outcome mapping and the launcher-only permission on flag-off builds. `--classes Notifications` without `--test-mocks` is refused by the runner, as intended. |

Manual checks on the launcher test-mocks build as HOME (adb input, read back with `dumpsys window`):
a swipe from the top edge opened Android's `NotificationShade`; with the real keyboard up after a
tap on the composer, 5 of 5 downward swipes on Home above it did not open the shade; after Back
hid the keyboard the composer kept focus and 5 of 5 pulls also did not (documented: a focused text
field owns the pull); on a fresh Home 3 of 3 pulls opened it; 3 upward swipes left Alpha in front.

Not established here: the `not-in-front` outcome and a launcher installed without
EXPAND_STATUS_BAR on a device (the outcome mapping is exercised with a fake status bar, and the
fallback texts by `settings-truth.production.spec.ts` in Chromium); real TalkBack; an overflowing
Home (landscape, large display size) on Android; `NotificationChannelsInstrumentedTest` (its
`channels` campaign was not run); the Pixel 10a and the AOSP image (#416, #417 stay open).

## Emulator results at 2961bd9e (2026-10-11, round 8 merged with round 9)

Class E only (emulator instrumentation), for these exact APKs. Not distributable-build,
physical-device, AOSP image, real-integration or user acceptance, and not evidence for any
later source. This is the first emulator record at upstream pin `13c98575987a`. It is a
written summary; the result files under `test-results/` are not committed. The sections below
are earlier campaigns and are kept as history.

- Source: branch `claude/r8-finish`, the round 8 packages merged with `main` at `394c4698`
  (round 9). App APKs A were built at `2961bd9e` and ran everything below unless a row says
  otherwise. `008ccf9d` and `f87850fa` change instrumented test source only; after each the
  app APKs were rebuilt byte-identical and only the instrumentation APKs changed. `a326b8dd`
  changes product source (the problem-log rejection found in this run) and `9a1ca161` test
  source; app APKs B were built at `9a1ca161` and ran the "final" rows.
- APKs: **developer builds with an unpackaged resident runtime, never distributable**:
  `npm run agent:prepare -- --source-only`, then `ALPHA_ANDROID_LOW_DISK=1 npm run android:build --
  --allow-unpackaged-runtime` (resident runtime not packaged), with an unqualified locally
  built speech AAR (`0ce9e976…`) and its developer-override `runtime-manifest.json`, which is
  not committed (every result file therefore says `dirty: true`). App APKs A:
  `standalone-debug.apk` `118c2f56…f4b4fff303`, `launcher-debug.apk` `6dfb7ce8…66f4ccd5`; app
  APKs B: `7c6d33f1…bbfaad41f2524` / `47e7c58e…b2867a2a0cb1a0`. Instrumentation APKs
  (standalone / launcher): set 1 at `2961bd9e` `946529ad…` / `f94b0f95…`; set 2 at `008ccf9d`
  `1b39fc2f…` / `592d58f9…`; set 3 at `f87850fa` `0037730b…` / `bc832485…`; final set at
  `9a1ca161` `fde2847b…` / `cb45b093…`. No test-mocks pair was built, so no test-mocks class ran.
- Emulator: AVD `r8_api36`, `system-images;android-36;default;arm64-v8a`, API 36 (Android 16
  `BE2A.250530.026.D1` userdebug), arm64-v8a, WebView `com.android.webview` 133.0.6943.137,
  serial `emulator-5670`. It was created by the round 8 session that stopped before recording
  anything and was reused here; it was left running, with stock HOME `com.android.launcher3`
  read back and no Alpha package installed. The guest was rebooted once (see the restart
  campaigns).
- Host load average was 15 to 40 during these runs (Chromium batches and Gradle beside them).
- Not run: the test-mocks classes, the reading classes that need isolated-world injection
  (no such WebView on this machine), RealClock (API 35 image), reminders, the other
  permission scenarios, `signin` restart, rotation, the media classes, the resident campaign,
  and every hosted job. Nothing was dispatched.

### `npm run test:android:instrumentation`

Results are standalone / launcher, instrumentation set 1 unless a row says otherwise.

| Class | Result | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LauncherHome (`--home-role`, launcher only) | passed in 21 of 22 runs with app APKs A, and 3 of 3 with app APKs B (5 methods) | The one failure was a process crash, a product defect: a `crashLog` call the page made just before the activity was destroyed reached `AlphaDevicePlugin`'s stopped worker, and the `RejectedExecutionException` on the bridge thread killed the process. The problem-log methods now answer such a call with a rejection (`a326b8dd`, `test/device-plugin-diagnostics.test.mjs`); other plugins that stop a worker in `handleOnDestroy` were not reviewed for the same path. The original HOME holder was read back after every run. |
| SettingsRoles (`--home-role`, launcher only) | with the test as round 8 wrote it: passed in 2 of 7 runs. With the final test: passed in 8 of 8 runs (app APKs A) and 3 of 3 (app APKs B) | Test defect, two conditions not awaited. Every failure was the same step of `homeRequestDeclineAndAcceptMatchRoleHolders`: after the role is accepted and a HOME key is injected, the page did not report the Home view within 20 s, with the one-instance assertions before it passing. (1) A HOME key injected before the page owner's window has input focus again starts nothing: the log shows no HOME start for the 20 s that followed. (2) The navigation helper keeps a 100 ms step pending after its target view renders; a HOME start that lands first is undone when that step finds Home and opens Settings again (with only (1) awaited the class passed 6 of 7 and the failing run had heard the HOME start). Each press now waits for window focus and for the helper to finish, and must be heard by the page as a HOME start (`9a1ca161`), which is stricter than before. Five of the first seven runs were before the guest reboot and two after. |
| Accessibility | **failed / failed** | Open, two different steps. Standalone: `Home at 200% font: reading order goes up from 'All apps' to 'Open conversation'`. At 200% Home has three columns and four rows of apps, and at the top of the scroll the last row is drawn under and below the floating composer, so the composer reads after controls that sit lower on the screen; the last row scrolls clear of the composer. Whether Home should end above the composer at this size is a layout question that was not changed here. Launcher: the same check passes by 16 px; the class then fails at "the accessibility click action opens the panel". The handle is found by name (after the lookup fix below) and `ACTION_CLICK` is accepted, but no click reaches the page. A diagnostic build showed the same for the "Open your calendar" card, while `ACTION_FOCUS` on the handle did move page focus: on this WebView (133) through UiAutomation, `ACTION_CLICK` dispatches no click to any page control, so the step cannot pass on this image. The measured text scale (2), the Home text-overlap and label-split checks and the two swipe checks before it passed on the launcher flavor. |
| Notifications, SettingsSystemFacts | passed / passed | Notifications now opens the panel through the handle. |
| TextScale | passed / passed | The restart method is skipped by its gate, as designed. |
| NoMockProduct, Shell, StartupReadiness, BrowserSignins, BrowserContinuity (default run) | passed / passed | Seven default classes per flavor; no BrowserDownload row. |
| BrowserFlow (default run) | failed 1 of 2 runnable / same | Environment, as in round 7: `submittedSearchUsesRealProviderAndRejectsExecutableAddress` needs a live `www.google.com/search` page; the page that loaded was HTTPS and complete but not that address. The default run therefore exits 1. |
| LocalAgentOfflineApps, NotesStorageDurability, DailyApps, ReminderLifecycle, ClockHandoff, ClockRepeatDays, HostedResultNotice, WorkflowApprovalNotice, InboxOperationJournal, MailAttachment, CameraScan | passed / passed | WorkflowApprovalNotice is the first run against the shared receipt ledger of pin `13c98575987a`. HostedResultNotice skips two methods by assumption. |
| PasswordBrowserFill | passed / passed | Standalone 4 of 4 runs, launcher 1 of 1. The round 7 failure did not recur; four runs do not prove the race closed. |
| FilesTree | passed / passed | Standalone 4 of 4 runs, launcher 1 of 1. Same caveat. |
| NotesTrashBackstop | failed / failed with set 1 (8 of 9 methods); passed / passed with set 2 (9 of 9) | Test defect in a method that had never run (`unreadableStoresMakeThePermanentDeletionPassANoOp`, round 9): it wrote text that is not JSON into the pending slot, and the secure store refuses such a write. The test now asserts that refusal, the unchanged slot and that the pass erases nothing (`008ccf9d`). |
| BrowserReadingNavigation | failed / failed | Environment: this WebView reports `JS_INJECTION_IN_FRAME_AND_WORLD=false`. Hosted job `browser-reading` is the way to run it. |

### Calendar (`scripts/test-calendar-regression.mjs`)

| Case | Result | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CalendarTruncationInstrumentedTest | passed / passed | Failed in round 7. The product fix of round 8 (`CalendarRangeReader`) holds on this image; the class is unchanged. First run on the launcher flavor. |
| CalendarAvailabilityInstrumentedTest | passed / passed | 4 tests on each flavor. First run of the class. |
| CalendarAgentCrudInstrumentedTest | reviewed method passed; `directSaveReadsBackAllDayChosenZoneAndRrule` (gate `calendarOptions`) failed on standalone with set 1, and both methods passed / passed with set 2 | First run of the options method. Test defect: it expected the recurring row's `DURATION` as `P3600S`; the shared calendar module writes `PT3600S`, which is what its own consumer test asserts (`008ccf9d`). |
| CalendarRangeInstrumentedTest, CalendarFlowInstrumentedTest (5 tests), CalendarCrudInstrumentedTest (2 tests) | passed / passed | They read through the bounded `AlphaCalendar.list`. |

### Campaigns from the developer archive

`node scripts/developer-archive.mjs` assembled the archive from the verified developer pairs
(set 2, and set 3 for `channels`).

| Campaign | Result | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `test-native-restart.mjs notes` | launcher passed 3 of 3, standalone passed 1 of 1 | After the guest reboot. Before it every campaign that writes a fixture through MediaStore failed with `SQLiteException: Exception thrown by custom scalar function` from the provider's insert, on an emulator that had been up for three hours; those attempts are not counted. Three runs do not prove the round 7 timeout closed. |
| `test-native-restart.mjs document` | standalone passed | The cancellation notice and the import receipt are still observed with the visibility-aware receipts. Launcher not run. |
| `test-native-restart.mjs inbox` | passed / passed | Includes the round 8 step: after the restart with local apps chosen, Inbox's "Connect Eliza Cloud" panel offers "Retry saved connection" and a new sign-in and shows no account. Superseded by P-43 (2026-10-13): the local-apps selection is retired; needs a re-run. |
| `test-native-permissions.mjs channels` | failed / failed with set 2 (twice); passed / passed with set 3 | Test defect caused by round 8 and missed by its review: the test clicked the first visible button whose text starts with "Notifications", which since round 8 is Home's handle (Home stays laid out under Settings), so it never reached the channel page. `CrossAppNotificationsRestartInstrumentedTest` had the same selector. Both now exclude the handle (`f87850fa`). |
| `android-workflow-native.mjs --phase=approval-notice` | 4 of 4 cases passed (2 per flavor) | A selection: `selectionPassed` true, `passed` false by design. |
| `android-workflow-native.mjs` (WorkflowPhoneNative and approval notice, 14 cases) | failed at its first case twice with set 2; **14 of 14 passed** with app APKs B and the final set (`passed: true`) | Test defect in a class that had never run: `privateReadResultSurvivesRecreationButNeverExpandsPassiveHistory` removed its journal fixture through the page's `AlphaConnection.secureRemove` and asserted success, but that bridge refuses native-only journal slots (`RendererCredentialSlots`). The test now asserts the refusal and removes the fixture through the native store (`9a1ca161`). `deniedCalendarGrantReturnsNoEvents` passed on both flavors (B-25, J01-7). |

### Found and changed in this run

- `AccessibilityInstrumentedTest` looked the handle up with `findAccessibilityNodeInfosByText`,
  which WebView's node provider answers with an empty list; it now walks the tree (`2961bd9e`).
- The test defects named in the tables (`008ccf9d`, `f87850fa`, `9a1ca161`) and one product
  defect, the problem-log rejection (`a326b8dd`). With app APKs B the HOME-role classes, the
  workflow campaign and NoMockProduct, Shell, StartupReadiness, Notifications,
  SettingsSystemFacts, WorkflowApprovalNotice and NotesTrashBackstop (both flavors, all passed)
  ran; nothing else was repeated on them.
- The hand-off fix `66a1a56c` was made by the earlier round 8 session from its own emulator
  run: at the source before it SettingsRoles and LauncherHome both failed because the live
  task was not raised. Its result files are not part of this record.
- Still open from this run: Accessibility on both flavors (two different steps, see its row),
  BrowserFlow's live-search method, and everything listed under "Not run".

## Emulator results at 6dcdde34 (2026-10-10, round 7)

Class E only (emulator instrumentation), for these exact APKs. Not distributable-build,
physical-device, AOSP image, real-integration or user acceptance, and not evidence for any later
source. The section below this one is the first campaign and is kept as history.

- Emulators (all created for this run and deleted afterwards; stock HOME
  `com.android.launcher3` read back before deletion, no Alpha package and no secondary user left):
  - `r7_api36`: `system-images;android-36;default;arm64-v8a`, API 36 (Android 16
    `BE2A.250530.026.D1` userdebug), arm64-v8a, WebView `com.android.webview` 133.0.6943.137.
    Every row below unless it says otherwise.
  - `r7_api35`: `system-images;android-35;default;arm64-v8a`, API 35 (`AE3A.240806.019`),
    WebView `com.android.webview` 124.0.6367.219. RealClock only.
  - `r7_g36`: `system-images;android-36;google_apis;arm64-v8a`, API 36, with
    `com.google.android.webview` 145.0.7632.218 installed over its 133 from the
    `android-37.0;google_apis` image already on this machine. The isolated-world check only.
- APKs: **developer-override builds, never distributable**: `npm run android:build --
  --allow-unpackaged-runtime` (resident runtime `NOT_PACKAGED`; the reviewed embedding host
  libraries are not on the build machine) with a speech runtime installed by
  `install-generated.py --allow-unqualified-runtime`. App APKs built at `55737f3b`:
  `standalone-debug.apk` `d085c16d…c61f0eb`, `launcher-debug.apk` `0e14b5c9…2205cf9`;
  test-mocks pair `57cda4aa…` / `81b580e2…`. The only later change to app source (`51a29979`)
  affects the browser build, not Android. Instrumentation APKs were rebuilt as tests were
  repaired, with the app APKs byte-identical: set B `ccb07e88…` / `5a224a96…` (the campaigns),
  set C at `6dcdde34` `cbdde6cc…` / `60647098…` (the instrumentation runner, the Calendar
  campaign and the notes rerun), test-mocks `559ae5f8…` / `da62c9db…`; RealClock ran with the
  set built at `55737f3b` (`19fe5d0d…` / `bc3c503e…`).
- The fixture campaigns ran from a hand-assembled directory of those APKs with a name-to-hash
  manifest; `scripts/build-archive.mjs` needs the strict build and was not run. The resident
  campaign (owner-held provider key) was not run.
- Host load was 13 to 60 during these runs. On the first attempt at the launcher half the
  emulator's `system_server` was killed by its watchdog (WindowManager blocked for 74 s) and the
  emulator was restarted; nothing from that attempt is counted.

### `npm run test:android:instrumentation`

Results are standalone / launcher. Result files: `test-results/android-instrumentation/r7-main`,
`r7-homerole`, `r7-accessibility`, `r7-mocks`, `r7-realclock-api35`, `r7-pbf-1..3`,
`r7-webview145-reading`.

| Class | Result | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NoMockProduct, Shell, StartupReadiness, Video, PhotosTrash, SettingsSystemFacts, NotesTrashBackstop, ClockHandoff, ClockRepeatDays, InboxOperationJournal, MailAttachment, NotesStorageDurability, ReminderLifecycle, Notifications, LocalAgentOfflineApps | passed / passed | |
| TextScale | passed 1 of 2 / same; restart phase skipped (restart runner) | |
| BrowserSignins | passed 5 of 6 / same; restart phase skipped (`signin` campaign, below) | |
| BrowserContinuity | passed 1 of 3 / same; two skipped (restart runner, test-mocks) | |
| HostedResultNotice | builders passed; posted and denied notices skipped here (`notice`, `notice-denied` campaigns, below) | |
| NotesSecureStorage | passed 1 of 2 / same; legacy migration skipped (gate, no campaign) | |
| DailyApps | passed 6 of 6 / passed 6 of 6 | Was failing. Test: a reminder tap is retained while the first-run sign-in panel is open and opens when it is answered; the test now asserts both. |
| WorkflowApprovalNotice | passed / passed | Was failing. Two product defects fixed (repeated post of a decided approval kept a tap route; the receipt read the notice list before Android had listed the notice). |
| CameraScan | passed 2 of 2 / same | Was failing. Product defect fixed (the scan model was packaged under the wrong name; see below) and three test defects (fixture PNGs counted as Photos rows, export read back with an unparsed quoted path, pages counted in compressed PDF objects). No duplicate save exists. |
| Accessibility | passed / passed | Was failing. Test: an empty text field's accessible name is its hint, which the checker did not read; on the launcher flavor the shade swipe started under Android's status bar. |
| FilesTree | passed / passed | The earlier standalone failure did not recur (also passed in two earlier round-7 runs); it was recorded at host load 30 to 140. Cause not established. |
| SettingsFlow | passed / passed | Was failing on standalone. Test: the standalone flavor lists no system-only rows by design; it now asserts that and runs the battery handoff on the launcher flavor. |
| Rotation | passed / passed | With the strict clipping rule (whole box inside the viewport and every clipping ancestor after the best scroll alignment). No clipping found. |
| PasswordBrowserFill | failed once then passed 3 of 3 / passed | One standalone run failed its own tap-geometry precondition ("Synthetic form tap stays inside the visible browser"); not reproduced in three reruns. Cause not established. |
| LauncherHome | not applicable / passed 4 of 4 with `--home-role` | HOME selected, cold HOME resumed, original holder restored and read back. |
| SettingsRoles | not applicable / passed 2 of 2 with `--home-role` | Was failing. Test: Android 16's role dialog ignores Back (decline uses Cancel), the row is the node whose text is exactly the app name, and becoming HOME starts a new activity instance. |
| BrowserFlow (flag-off) | failed 1 of 2 runnable / same | Environment: `submittedSearchUsesRealProviderAndRejectsExecutableAddress` needs a live `www.google.com/search` page; the page that loaded was HTTPS and complete but not that address (every run this round). |
| BrowserDownload (flag-off) | skipped / skipped (test-mocks gate) | |
| BrowserReadingNavigation, BrowserPageQuestion (3 of 4) | failed / failed | Environment: no WebView provider on this machine reports `JS_INJECTION_IN_FRAME_AND_WORLD`. 133 (API 36 default image) and 145.0.7632.218 (the newest, from the API 37 image, installed on `r7_g36`) both report false; CI's fixture uses Chromium snapshot 157.0.8083.0 (x86_64). |
| RealClock (`--clock-exclusive`, `r7_api35`) | passed / passed | The fixture is qualified for API 35 and asserts it. It also needs AOSP Clock's notification permission, which the runner now grants. Not run on API 36. |
| Test-mocks: BrowserDownload, ConnectionChooser, BrowserAutofill | passed / passed | BrowserAutofill's intermittent failure was the test's reading of the closing popup window (10 of 10 fresh-data runs passed after the fix; 4 of 8 failed before). |
| Test-mocks: HostedProcessRestart, HostedBackgroundWorker | passed 3 of 3 phases, passed / same | New secondary-user phase: users 11 and 12 created, used and removed. Both classes need the test-mocks build (loopback HTTP fixture). |
| Test-mocks: BrowserFlow | passed 4 of 5 / same | Same live-search dependency; upload, stop/reload and the error page pass. |
| Test-mocks: BrowserReading, BrowserSensitiveReading, BrowserIsolatedReading | failed / failed | Environment: isolated-world injection (above). On a test-mocks build the sensitive-page rejections pass and the classes stop at the review dialog that needs the isolated world. "The product asks for a speech route first" was the correct refusal on a build without test mocks: their synthetic HTTP route is admitted by a test-mocks build only, and they are now registered and asserted that way. |

### Fixture campaigns (fresh secondary user per run)

Result files: `test-results/r7-camp/<campaign>-<flavor>`, `test-results/calendar-regression-1791688*`.

| Campaign | Result (standalone / launcher) | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `test-native-restart.mjs signin`, `document` | passed / passed | |
| `test-native-restart.mjs notes` | passed / failed then passed | The first launcher run timed out waiting for "Export saved and exact bytes verified." after the system picker; the rerun passed. Cause not established. |
| `test-native-restart.mjs inbox` | passed / passed | Was failing. Test: the Android account panel names the signed-in state differently, Inbox loads the mailbox itself, and after a restart with local apps chosen the saved sign-in is offered as "Retry saved connection" in Settings, not restored. Superseded by P-43 (2026-10-13): the local-apps selection is retired; needs a re-run. |
| `test-native-permissions.mjs channels`, `settings`, `voice-limit`, `voice-revoke` | passed / passed | |
| `test-native-permissions.mjs camera` | passed / passed | Was failing. Product defect fixed: a second permission dialog opened straight after "Don't allow". |
| `test-native-permissions.mjs voice` | passed / passed | Was failing. Product defect fixed (the "Open app settings" control the denied message names was missing) and the test now signs in through the closed synthetic Cloud transport, because a build without test mocks records only through Eliza Cloud voice. |
| `test-native-permissions.mjs notice`, `notice-denied` | passed / passed | Was failing. Test: the fixture wrote native-only result slots through the page bridge, which refuses them. |
| `test-reminder-one-off.mjs` | passed / passed | |
| `test-reminder-recovery.mjs` | passed / passed | First run. Reboots the emulator. |
| `test-calendar-regression.mjs` CalendarCrud, CalendarAgentCrud, CalendarFlow, CalendarRange, CalendarCreationRecovery | passed / passed | CalendarCrud was failing. Test: the modal access panel covered the real touch, and scroll-driven animations report running forever. |
| `test-calendar-regression.mjs` CalendarTruncation | failed / not run | First run of this class. "Calendar results incomplete" never appears. Not triaged. The runner stops at the first failure, so the launcher cases above were run one by one with `--variant=launcher --case=`. |
| Resident campaign (`ResidentEgressRedaction`, `ResidentService`) | not run | Needs the packaged runtime and reads an owner-held provider key. |

### Product defects found by these runs and fixed on this branch

- The Android asset merger unpacked `ocr/eng.traineddata.gz` and dropped the suffix, so no APK
  carried the name the scan engine requests and every Android scan ended with "The image could
  not be read by the local scan engine". `android:sync` now protects `*.gz` web assets and
  `verify-apks` fails an APK whose gzip assets differ from the web build.
- A repeated post for a decided phone-step approval left a tap route behind; the approval and
  step receipts could record "unknown" for a notice Android was about to show.
- Closing Android's camera permission dialog with "Don't allow" restarted the preview and asked
  again at once.
- The denied-microphone message told the owner to choose "Open app settings", a control lost in
  merge `344d1305`.
- The native browser page stayed above modal host panels (the first-run access panel, the
  connection panel) and remained interactive.

### Observed and left open

- Inbox's "Connect Eliza Cloud" panel offers only a new sign-in when a saved sign-in exists and
  local apps are selected; the saved one is offered in Settings › Agent connection. Owner decision.
  Superseded by P-43 (2026-10-13, resident agent always present): there is no local-apps
  selection any more, so this observation and the `test-native-restart.mjs inbox` steps above
  that restart "with local apps chosen" describe a retired state. The records stand as the
  evidence of their date; the campaign and `LocalAgentOfflineAppsInstrumentedTest` (replaced by
  `ResidentAlwaysPresentInstrumentedTest`) need a re-run.
- On the launcher flavor a swipe from the very top opens Android's shade and a swipe from just
  below it opens Alpha's. Owner decision for the AOSP image.
- At 200% font the Home card title and app labels overlap or cut (screenshots taken while
  triaging Accessibility; the instrumentation's bounds checks do not catch it). Not fixed.
- Accepting the HOME role starts a second `MainActivity` in the home task while the first stays
  in its own task.

### Round 8 follow-up to "Observed and left open" (source and browser tests only)

Branch `claude/r8-ui-defects`. Nothing in this subsection was run on an emulator: the browser
results are class S, and the instrumented tests named here were compiled
(`:app:compileLauncherDebugJavaWithJavac`, `:app:compileLauncherDebugAndroidTestJavaWithJavac`,
`:app:compileStandaloneDebugAndroidTestJavaWithJavac`) and not run. The four observations above
stand as what the round-7 APKs do; this records what changed in source afterwards.

| Round-7 observation | Classification | Change | Evidence at this source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Inbox's "Connect Eliza Cloud" panel offers only a new sign-in when a saved one exists | Plain defect, not an owner decision: the same saved sign-in was already offered in Settings | The Inbox panel offers "Retry saved connection" under the Settings panel's rules (`runtime/connection-ui.tsx`) | `saved-signin-retry.production.spec.ts` (flag-off bundle, stubbed Android bridge, both panels). `InboxDraftInstrumentedTest` restart phase asserts the Inbox offer; compiled, not run. At `2961bd9e` the `inbox` restart campaign passed on both flavors with the Inbox's "Retry saved connection" step (class E, developer APKs) |
| A top-edge swipe opens Android's shade, a swipe just below opens Alpha's | The zones are decided by the PRD and flow audit (the status shade is Android's); what stays with the owner is listed in [core loop status](core-loop-status.md#gesture-zones-and-the-notifications-panel-round-8) | Alpha's notifications open only from a visible handle on Home ([gesture zones](gesture-zones.md)) | `notifications-handle.spec.ts`, the accessibility sweeps. `AccessibilityInstrumentedTest` covers the zones. Run at `2961bd9e` (class E, developer APKs): `Notifications` opened the panel through the handle on both flavors, and on the launcher flavor Accessibility passed the two swipe checks and then failed at its accessibility-click step (see that run) |
| At 200% font the Home card title and app labels overlap or cut | Plain defect (PRD AP-15) | Home cards grow with their text, tile grids drop a column when labels stop fitting, both driven by the measured text scale (`runtime/text-scale.ts`, `phone.css`) | `large-text-overlap.spec.ts`; the overlap rules of `accessibility-audit.ts` over every retained view at 100% and 200% (`accessibility-sweep.spec.ts`, production sweep). `AccessibilityInstrumentedTest` reads the measured scale and checks Home overlap in the WebView. Run at `2961bd9e` (class E, developer APKs): on the launcher flavor the measured scale (2) and the overlap and label-split checks passed; on standalone the class failed at the 200% reading order (the last Home row under the composer), which the MVP completion integration fixed in the renderer and has not rerun |
| Accepting the HOME role starts a second `MainActivity` | Plain defect: two pages over one store, and the in-flight state stayed in the hidden one | The first live instance is kept and later starts are handed to it (`MainActivity`, "One live MainActivity") | `SettingsRolesInstrumentedTest`, `LauncherHomeInstrumentedTest`. Run at `2961bd9e`/`9a1ca161` (class E, developer APKs): both passed in the `--home-role` phase after two unawaited test conditions were fixed |

Other rows of the tables above, re-read for product defects:

- `CalendarTruncation` ("Calendar results incomplete" never appears) is not an owner decision.
  The class assumes "the actual native 2,000-instance cap". The shared upstream reader
  (`plugin-native-calendar`, `CalendarPlugin.list`, read at `40dbe96bd1`) reads every instance
  in the requested range and always answers `truncated: false`, so the 2,002 fixture rows were
  all returned and the renderer's incomplete-result notice (`calendar-adapter.ts`) could not
  appear. This package left it unchanged; the runner package of the same round restored the
  bound in the product (`CalendarRangeReader`, see "Round 8" above), with the class unchanged.
- The first-run failures recorded as "cause not established" (the launcher `notes` restart
  campaign, `PasswordBrowserFill`, `FilesTree`) were left open by this package. The runner
  package of the same round read a cause for each from the saved result files (see "Round 8"
  above); none of those fixes has an emulator run.
- Found while checking large text: in the standalone app the app library left a 44px strip of
  Home visible above it (the library kept the launcher's status-bar offset). Fixed in
  `phone.css`; `large-text-overlap.spec.ts` asserts the library covers the screen.

Independent review of the above (same branch, source and browser tests only; no emulator). It
changed five things:

- `NotificationsInstrumentedTest` and `NotificationChannelsInstrumentedTest` opened Alpha's
  panel with a synthetic swipe from the top band, which the product no longer answers, so both
  would have timed out on the next emulator run. They now go to Home and click the handle.
- The launcher handle's margin below the status bar was computed in canvas pixels against an
  inset in screen pixels. On a screen narrower than the 412px canvas the margin shrank (under
  8px at 360px wide with a 48px bar) and a 100px bar overlapped the handle. The rule now divides
  by the canvas scale; `notifications-handle.spec.ts` measures it on screen at three widths.
- The hand-off read the live instance's kind (home or standard) from the intent the instance
  held when it was created. A relaunch is handed the last intent given to `setIntent`, where the
  Cloud sign-in return is kept, so after a sign-in and then a relaunch (a system font-size
  change, renderer recovery) a home-type instance was treated as standard and a later notice tap
  or sign-in return would have been delivered without Alpha coming to the front. The kind is
  now kept per task id. `LauncherHomeInstrumentedTest` has a method for it; it ran with the class at `2961bd9e`/`9a1ca161` (5 methods, passed; class E, developer APKs).
- The hand-off could repeat without end. If the bring-to-front start missed the live instance,
  the home-type instance still finished and left the home task empty, and Android would start
  HOME again. The process now stops handing starts off when a front start makes a new instance,
  cannot be made, or goes unreceived three times in a row; a new start then keeps its own
  instance, which is the two-instance state round 7 measured. Whether the front start reaches
  the live task on a given image is still an emulator question (logcat tag `AlphaInstance`).
- Smaller: the front-start marker extra is read without trusting a foreign parcel, and the
  instance that hands off never removes a task it shares with the live one.

The Java at the reviewed head was compiled for both flavors (app and androidTest sources) with
plain `javac` against the Gradle cache's dependency jars and the generated classes of an existing
build of the same base commit, not with Gradle; no APK was assembled and no lint was run on the
review's changes. Every native statement in this subsection is still class S.

Run in review (class S): `npm run verify` exit 0 (647 node tests: 643 pass, 0 fail, 4 todo;
bundle audit `PASS web-dist`); the production Playwright project, 183 passed; in the Chromium
project the accessibility audit, resilience and sweep specs, `large-text-*`,
`notifications-handle`, `home-*`, `root-view-states`, `fixtures-empty-runtime`,
`standalone-shell`, `native-insets`, `compact-viewport` and `design`, 726 passed. The rest of
the Chromium project was not rerun in review. With the fixed card height and the fixed four
columns put back, `large-text-overlap.spec.ts` failed 5 of 11, so the spec does detect the
round-7 defect.

## Emulator results at 73b973a5 (2026-10-10)

Class E only (emulator instrumentation). Not physical-device, AOSP image, real-integration or
user acceptance, and not evidence for any later source.

Scope of this record. It is a written summary by the session that ran the campaign, and it is
the only committed form of it: the runner's `results.json` files and raw logs are not in the
repository, and the APK hashes below are abbreviated. The source ran at upstream pin `352d7a08`,
not the later pins `40dbe96bd1` (round 7) or `13c9857598` (current since round 9). Changes made after `73b973a5` in response to these results
have no run in this section: the approval-notice route release and posted-notice wait, the gzip
packaging of the scan model, the camera resume decision, the "Open app settings" control, hiding
the native browser page under modal panels, the secondary-user phase of the runner, the role
dialog driver in SettingsRoles, and the later test repairs. Rows marked failed or unresolved
describe `73b973a5`; nothing in this section shows them fixed. Their later runs, at pin
`40dbe96bd1`, are the round 7 section above ("Emulator results at 6dcdde34"), which is the same
kind of record: a written summary whose result files under `test-results/` are not committed.

- Emulator: AVD `r3_packaging_api36`, system image `system-images;android-36;default;arm64-v8a`
  (API 36, Android 16 `BE2A.250530.026.D1` userdebug), ABI arm64-v8a, stock HOME
  `com.android.launcher3`, WebView `com.android.webview` 133.0.6943.137.
- APKs: **developer-override builds, never distributable**: `npm run android:build --
  --allow-unpackaged-runtime` (resident runtime `NOT_PACKAGED`: the reviewed embedding host
  libraries are not on the build machine) with a speech runtime installed by
  `install-generated.py --allow-unqualified-runtime`. App: `standalone-debug.apk`
  `3bcac1ad…7ba516b`, `launcher-debug.apk` `666f7a65…c5934e`. Instrumentation APKs at `bef5cd5b`
  `2bf1dcce…` / `3bf3eef7…` (rows marked A) and at `73b973a5` `5b3cdd0e…` / `755acbc2…` (rows
  marked B). Test-mocks pair: `5b126815…` / `8c13d13a…` with `caccd38c…` / `4c0c9cc9…`.
- The fixture campaigns ran from a hand-assembled directory of those APKs with a name-to-hash
  manifest; `scripts/build-archive.mjs` needs the strict build and was not run.
- The machine was heavily loaded (load average 30 to 140), so a timeout seen once is listed as
  not reproduced rather than as a defect.

### `npm run test:android:instrumentation`

Results are standalone / launcher. "skipped" names the gate.

| Class | Result | Classification |

| BrowserContinuity | passed 1 of 3 / same; two skipped (restart runner, test-mocks) (A) | |
| BrowserFlow (flag-off) | 1 of 2 real-HTTPS tests failed / passed (A) | Environment: `submittedSearchUsesRealProviderAndRejectsExecutableAddress` needs a live `www.google.com/search` page; it failed in 3 of 6 runs. The other test passes since the lock selector fix. |
| BrowserDownload (flag-off) | skipped / skipped (test-mocks gate) (A) | |

| Rotation | passed / passed (B) | Two test defects fixed (see below). |
| SettingsFlow | failed (`Battery` row not found) / passed (B) | Not reproduced on launcher; standalone unresolved. |
| Accessibility | failed / failed (B) | Reaches its TalkBack order check and reports `Home at 200% font: unlabelled control` at the composer area. Open: product accessibility finding or checker limit; not triaged further. |
| NotesTrashBackstop, ClockHandoff, ClockRepeatDays, InboxOperationJournal, MailAttachment | passed / passed (A) | |
| HostedResultNotice | builders passed; posted and denied notices skipped (permission runner) (A) | |
| NotesSecureStorage | passed 1 of 2 / same; legacy migration skipped (gate) (A) | |
| LauncherHome | not applicable / passed 4 of 4 with `--home-role` (A, B) | HOME selected, cold HOME resumed, original holder `com.android.launcher3` restored and read back. |
| SettingsRoles | not applicable / failed 1 of 2 (A, B) | `homeRequestDeclineAndAcceptMatchRoleHolders`: "Home app not changed" never appears after declining Android's role dialog. Unresolved (three runs). |
| LocalAgentOfflineApps, NotesStorageDurability, ReminderLifecycle, Notifications, PasswordBrowserFill | passed / passed on rerun (B) | Each failed once on one flavor in the first run (A) under load; not reproduced. |
| FilesTree | failed twice / passed twice (A, B) | Standalone only: `Open Renamed destination` never appears and the Files view is empty. Unresolved. |
| DailyApps | failed 1 of 6 / same (A, B: three runs) | `localReminderPostsRealNotificationAndTapOpensItsContext`: the notification tap does not open the reminder's Calendar detail. Unresolved. |
| WorkflowApprovalNotice | failed 1 of 2 / same (A, B) | With the notification permission granted it posts, then fails later (`unknown` status, or the route not released). Unresolved. |
| BrowserReading, BrowserSensitiveReading | failed / failed (A) | Test precondition: without a speech route the product answers "Select an available speech route before reading" before the sensitivity check the tests expect. |
| BrowserIsolatedReading, BrowserReadingNavigation, BrowserPageQuestion (3 of 4) | failed / failed (A) | Environment: this WebView reports `JS_INJECTION_IN_FRAME_AND_WORLD=false`; the classes need isolated-world injection. |
| CameraScan | failed 2 of 2 / same (A, B) | Open: the review dialog reports "The image could not be read by the local scan engine" for the fixture pages; a picked image also left a second Photos row. Not triaged to a cause. |
| RealClock (`--clock-exclusive`) | failed / failed (A) | Environment: the fixture asserts API 35; this image is API 36. |
| HostedProcessRestart, HostedBackgroundWorker | refused by the runner | They assert a disposable secondary user no runner creates. |
| Test-mocks: BrowserDownload, ConnectionChooser | passed / passed | |
| Test-mocks: BrowserFlow | passed 5 of 5 / 4 of 5 | Same live-search dependency. |
| Test-mocks: BrowserAutofill | failed / failed in the runner; passed 4 of 4 run alone | The synthetic autofill service fills both fields through the framework every time. The intermittent failure is later: Android's suggestion popup stayed visible for ten seconds after the Menu overlay made the tab ineligible ("Overlay cancels native credential suggestion", cycle 0 or 1). Cause not isolated. |

### Fixture campaigns (fresh secondary user per run)

| Campaign | Result (standalone / launcher) | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `test-native-restart.mjs signin`, `notes`, `document` | passed / passed (A) | |
| `test-native-restart.mjs inbox` | failed / failed (A, B) | The test waited for the "Cloud services connected" heading removed in `9aa75ce1`. With the wait changed to the signed-in account summary it still times out: the synthetic sign-in never shows a signed-in account. Unresolved. |
| `test-native-permissions.mjs channels`, `settings`, `voice-limit` | passed / passed (A) | |
| `test-native-permissions.mjs voice-revoke` | passed (B) / passed (A) | The first standalone run stopped in the runner, which parsed `cat`'s "No such file" text as the marker; fixed. |
| `test-native-permissions.mjs camera` | failed / failed (A) | Test expects "Tap the shutter to retry"; the product shows "Camera access is off" with Open Android settings and Try again. Stale expectation or changed denial path; unresolved. |
| `test-native-permissions.mjs voice` | failed / failed (A) | "Record without transcription" never offered. Unresolved. |
| `test-native-permissions.mjs notice`, `notice-denied` | failed / failed (A, B) | The test reflected a plugin field that no longer exists (fixed); it now fails on a later bare assertion. Unresolved. |
| `test-reminder-one-off.mjs` | passed / passed (A) | |
| `test-calendar-regression.mjs --case=CalendarAgentCrudInstrumentedTest` | passed / passed (A) | |
| `test-calendar-regression.mjs --case=CalendarCrudInstrumentedTest` | failed twice / not run (A, B) | An event row never satisfies the visible-and-hit-testable condition. Unresolved; the runner stops before the launcher variant. |
| `test-reminder-recovery.mjs`, resident campaign (`ResidentEgressRedaction`, `ResidentService`) | not run | Recovery reboots the emulator (left for last); the resident campaign needs the packaged runtime and reads an owner-held provider key. |

### Confirmed on this image

- `AlphaDevicePlugin.snapshot()` at target SDK 36 returns `wifiEnabled`, `bluetoothEnabled`,
  `airplaneMode`, `locationEnabled`, `mobileDataEnabled`, `interruptionFilter` and
  `adaptiveBrightness`, matching `settings get global` and the Bluetooth service state, and follows
  an airplane-mode change. No read was refused.
- Closing Android's own shade did **not** refresh an open Alpha shade: while `NotificationShade`
  held window focus and after it closed, the page received no `focus`, `blur`, `visibilitychange`
  or `appResumed`, and made no new snapshot call. `MainActivity.onWindowFocusChanged` now tells the
  page. Re-measured with the fix: one `focus` event and one new snapshot call after the system shade
  closed over an open Alpha shade.
- `LocalSpeechInstrumentedTest` passed 2 of 2 on this emulator with networking off against the
  speech candidate rebuilt at this pin (recorded through `requalify-runtime.py run`; not admitted,
  x86_64 not executed).

### Defects found by these runs and fixed on this branch

Runner: classes shared app data and a left-open system shade (now cleared before each class);
secondary-user classes were run to certain failure; `WorkflowApprovalNotice` had no notification
permission; an empty listing was reported "missing" with nothing recorded; `voice-revoke` marker
polling. Tests: nine browser classes selected `svg[aria-label="Secure connection"]` after the icon
became a `role=img` span; Rotation's clipping rule failed portrait Home and compared a quoted
string; gesture tests did not settle the startup access panel; `InboxDraft` and
`HostedResultNotice` referred to removed product details.

## Evidence and reporting

Keep generated logs, screenshots and machine-readable receipts under ignored
`test-results/` or CI artifacts. Link the exact workflow run and commit when reporting
results; consult [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/AlphaCompute/alphaphone/actions)
for hosted status. Record failures, skipped cases and unavailable prerequisites along
with the passing subset. A rerun replaces evidence only for the scope it executes.
Never carry a dated APK or device result forward as proof for changed source.

Report source checks, APK builds, emulator/HOME tests, real integrations, custom
image boot and physical/user acceptance separately. Requirement evidence remains
unset until a retained, revision-bound result supports that requirement's full scope.

## Resident reuse and native runner phases (2026-10-10)

Assistant surface reuse (MVP-16): `Agent.start` attaches a surface to the resident agent that is
already admitted, running, enrolled and launched under the stored provider admission. An attach
keeps the runtime epoch, the owner enrollment and other surfaces' calls and streams; it never
pairs, and cancelling it retires nothing. Any doubt (runtime not listening, restarted runtime,
expiring or missing enrollment, changed or unadmitted provider, retirement in progress, an
unverified earlier attach) takes the ordinary start path. `Agent.residentAttachment` is the
read-only query the renderer uses to skip the stop-and-rebind of an unchanged Cloud provider;
the credit gate still runs first. A surface whose attach did not yield a verified owner session
stops asking to attach, so its retry stops, rebinds and restarts as before. Not covered: two
surfaces starting before any enrollment exists still supersede each other, and a lone surface
recreated after the last one was destroyed pairs again. Source checks: `test/resident-attachment.test.mjs` (JVM
contract of `ResidentAttachment`, renderer contract, start-path guards). The dual-Activity
case is `AssistantResidentReuseInstrumentedTest`; it uses a synthetic runtime observation,
enrollment and streams, so a passing run is emulator-class evidence of surface ownership only,
not of a live inference stream surviving, and never device acceptance.

Native runner phases (MVP-18): `node scripts/test-reminder-upgrade.mjs` now also runs
`WorkflowLegacyReminderUpgradeInstrumentedTest` on both distributions after the candidate verify
phase, against the same upgraded data. Calendar and reminder upgrades admit the candidate app
and instrumentation APK as one verified pair from `artifacts/apk-manifest.json` and
`artifacts/instrumentation/` (`npm run android:build`); shared Gradle outputs are no longer
installed, and companion classes run only while the installed bytes match that pair.
`node scripts/android-workflow-native.mjs` adds an `approval-notice` phase
(`WorkflowApprovalNoticeInstrumentedTest`, both methods, both distributions; the OS-posting
case is granted `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` in its owned user). Each receipt names its phase and APK
hashes; a failed, skipped or missing phase is recorded (`failedPhase` / `failure`) and exits
non-zero. Source checks: `test/installed-upgrade-runner.test.mjs` and
`test/native-campaign-evidence.test.mjs` drive the real scripts against a synthetic `adb`;
they are not emulator evidence. Approval notices across process death and account change had
no native phase at that date; round 10 added one (see "Round 10" above), which has not run.

Review follow-up (same date): an attach keeps the epoch, so a request the attaching surface had
queued earlier is refused before it pairs or is dispatched (`requireOwned`); a lifecycle change
made by another surface during an attach does not make this surface stop the resident on retry.
Both runners bind the bytes upstream pins to the admitted hashes in `preflightVariant`, before
any install, so a build that overwrites the archive after admission fails the run instead of
being recorded under the admitted hashes. These are source checks only, as above.

## Native source pin integration (2026-10-15; historical 968348 baseline)

The native build reference source pin is `968348d792d3d36df129bc53bd85cebed47d0830`.
It contains merged Eliza #36157 and #36292. Its llama.cpp gitlink is
`3e5f73922ee804806a2e955b50843a5042e6e401`, fork main after upstream integration
#72 and the native build repairs in #80. All existing native patch target
hashes match this Eliza revision unchanged. The bounded secure-storage memory
and reset-revocation tests also pass at this candidate pin (two tests).

At this llama.cpp revision the local Release CPU speech library and architecture
test target built. The ABI, Parakeet kernel and Kokoro layer-option tests passed.
The full native build in the server-disabled configuration failed at test-chat
because its server header requires mtmd.h. This is separate from the passing
speech targets. Eliza #36292 passed all hosted checks and local `bun run verify`.

New Android engine and full/voice-subset JNI libraries built for both ABIs.
Their measured hashes are recorded in the unqualified voice-host manifest; ELF
architecture, required exports and 16 KiB alignment checks passed. The separate
resident-host qualification receipt remains historical and unchanged. A source pin or development library build does not establish
emulator, AOSP boot, physical-device or distribution qualification.


## Maps relay admission pin (2026-10-15)

The consumer now admits `2d1c8a9071dc5db1db253b940e4eba350e389861`, a single
Maps relay commit directly above `968348d792d3d36df129bc53bd85cebed47d0830`.
The develop-based equivalent is [Eliza #36303](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/36303).
[Source equivalence](evidence/maps-relay-pin-source-equivalence-2026-10-15.json)
records every changed path, unchanged native gitlinks and matching existing native
patch target hashes. Native source, build scripts and JNI inputs are unchanged.
Only source-admission markers advance: native build reference hashes remain tied
to 968348, the embedding receipt remains historical and rejected, and voice
qualification remains false. No new-pin native execution or acceptance is claimed.

The corrected Bun lock adds the Maps workspace dependency without changing any
package version. A fresh resident dependency audit of this exact pin returned the
same 98 findings across 3675 package versions and the same normalized input hash;
existing reviewed dispositions and deadlines remain unchanged. This does not
replace a packaged-runtime audit or device qualification. Hosted consumer checks
and the upstream review/CI gate remain required before integration is accepted.
