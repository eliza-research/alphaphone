# Native Cloud authentication deployment diagnosis — October 24, 2026

This record covers public service probes and the supported Cloud registration
administration workflow. It does not establish a completed user sign-in, Google
consent, mobile credential issuance, or phone acceptance.

## Public observations

Observed on October 24, 2026 (approximately 11:20–11:25 UTC):

| Request | Result | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET https://api.eliza.app/api/v1/app-auth/mobile/config`, client `ai.elizaresearch.alphaphone`, environment `production`, redirect `https://eliza.app/alphaphone/auth/callback` | HTTP 503, `server_configuration_error`, “Configured mobile App Auth app is not active and approved” | The registered client cannot presently issue the required mobile credential. Reconfirmed after the failed repair. |
| `GET /steward/auth/providers?tenantId=elizacloud` | HTTP 200; email and Google enabled | Provider discovery works; no account was authenticated. |
| `POST /steward/auth/email/code/send` with `{}` | HTTP 400, “email is required” | The email-code route exists. No address was supplied and no email was sent. |
| `GET https://eliza.app/.well-known/assetlinks.json` | HTTP 200; Alpha package and the installed development signer's SHA-256 listed | The previously observed missing association file is now deployed. Device verification and production signing remain separate checks. |
| `GET https://eliza.app/alphaphone/auth/callback` | HTTP 200 | The fallback return page exists. This is not successful Android App Link handling. |
| Steward Google authorize with the exact Alpha callback, `tenant_id=elizacloud`, fresh S256 challenge/state and `prompt=select_account` | HTTP 400, “redirect_uri is not allowed for this tenant” | The tenant callback allowlist blocks Google before provider login. No authorization URL nonce/state or provider credentials are retained here. |
| `GET /steward/tenants/elizacloud/redirect-urls` without authentication | HTTP 401, “Authentication required” | The supported tenant administration route exists; an authorized operator session is required. |

## Supported registration diagnosis and repair

The `elizaOS/eliza` **Mobile App Auth Registration Admin** workflow accepts the
exact client, environment and operation. Its protected registry resolves the
client's app UUID; the workflow does not ask the operator to copy secrets into a
shell command or chat.

1. [Initial diagnostic run](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/actions/runs/40089604953)
   used the repository's default `develop` branch and was rejected before execution
   because production permits `main` only. No protection rule was changed.
2. [Diagnostic run on permitted main](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/actions/runs/40089648101)
   selected `target_environment=production`, `operation=diagnose`,
   `client=ai.elizaresearch.alphaphone`. Required schemas were present. It failed
   with `ELIZA_MOBILE_APP_AUTH_APP_ID does not resolve to an apps registration`.
3. [Scoped repair run on main](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/actions/runs/40089720955)
   selected the same client/environment and `operation=repair`. It failed at
   `authority.organization_active`. The registered Alpha app row was absent and
   the protected creation organization was missing or inactive. The repair
   transaction rolled back; no registration changes were committed.

The repair implementation validates organization activity, owner activity,
same-organization membership, owner/admin role, unique callback ownership and
generated-key ownership. An absent app row requires the protected organization
and owner inputs. No organization was activated, no owner was invented and no
other application's registration was reused.

## Remaining configuration work

For mobile credential issuance, reconcile the **production** protected inputs:

- `ELIZA_MOBILE_APP_AUTH_CLIENTS_JSON`: enabled Alpha client with its intended app
  UUID and exact production callback.
- `ELIZA_MOBILE_APP_AUTH_ORGANIZATION_ID` and
  `ELIZA_MOBILE_APP_AUTH_OWNER_USER_ID`: the intended active organization and its
  active authorized owner/admin. Determine whether these references are stale or
  require legitimate organization recovery; do not activate an unrelated row.
- After reconciliation, rerun the supported `repair` operation for the Alpha
  client on `main`, then `diagnose`, and require public mobile/config HTTP 200
  with the matching binding and S256.

For Google, the tenant `elizacloud` must admit exactly
`https://eliza.app/alphaphone/auth/callback` in `allowedRedirectUrls`. The supported
canonical endpoint is
`POST https://api.eliza.app/steward/tenants/elizacloud/redirect-urls` with
`{"url":"https://eliza.app/alphaphone/auth/callback"}`. It appends rather than
replacing other callbacks and records an audit event. Source requires an
owner/admin session and recent MFA according to tenant policy. No such session
was supplied in this investigation. `STEWARD_OAUTH_ALLOWED_REDIRECTS` is not a
substitute: the authorize request specifies `tenant_id` and uses that tenant's
allowlist. Read back the list, then require authorize to redirect to Google's
account origin before attempting user sign-in.

Keep the deployed `ELIZA_ANDROID_ASSET_LINKS_JSON` association aligned with the
actual installed signer and enable the corresponding callback intent filter in
the APK. Android must verify the host. A successful email or Google Steward
session still needs the mobile connect/token/ack sequence; the registration 503
cannot be fixed by displaying a hosted login page.

## Source references

The administration workflow and scripts were inspected through GitHub at the
selected repository refs:

- `.github/workflows/mobile-app-auth-registration-admin.yml`
- `packages/scripts/cloud/admin/repair-mobile-app-auth-registration.ts`
- `packages/scripts/cloud/admin/verify-mobile-app-auth-registration.ts`

The callback and operator contracts were inspected in the existing local shared
source checkout `eliza-alpha-internal-auth`:

- `packages/cloud/api/README.md`, “Alpha Phone in-app sign-in”
- `packages/auth/src/server/api/routes/tenant-config.ts`, redirect URL routes and
  `requireRecentTenantAdminMfa`

No secrets, authorization codes, user tokens or private account contents are
included in this record. The failed workflow checks are configuration evidence,
not successful integration acceptance.
