# Remaining browser persistence audit

The transactional migrations in [browser-storage.md](browser-storage.md) do not
complete the persistence review. This audit covers independent renderer stores,
operation intents and delegated storage ports outside the canonical browser
domains. It is a source review, not a claim that every
listed path has reproduced data loss or passed concurrency qualification.

## Audit boundary

Inspect direct `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` writes together with delegated
storage ports. A direct-call count does not establish whether readers and
writers share the same authority. The domains below remain outside the
canonical browser documents described in [browser storage](browser-storage.md).

Single-value preferences are not automatically equivalent to a multi-record
journal. The required invariant depends on the stored meaning: a preference may
intentionally be last-writer-wins, whereas an uncertain external operation must
retain its exact request identity until authoritative reconciliation.

## Outstanding domains

| Domain and authoritative source | Current mechanism and concrete concern | Required implementation and exit evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Connection selection and Cloud environment: `runtime/connection-ui.tsx` | Individual nonsecret preferences remain in renderer storage. Credential storage is separate. Conversation restart choices now have an atomic document implementation described below. | Verify selection/environment winner semantics, cross-tab retirement, and late authentication completions. Browser conversation tests do not establish native persistence or credential acceptance. |
| Appearance and simulated location: `prototype/settings-adapter.ts`, `browser/location-simulation.ts` | Individual preference values with events/readback. These do not share the multi-record receipt semantics above. | Verify deliberate last-writer-wins behavior, malformed-value handling, cross-tab refresh and pending sensor cancellation. Migrate only if the required invariant needs stronger coordination; avoid adding a redundant writable mirror. |

## Scope distinctions

Cloud setup intents, workflow pending requests and saved-copy requests now use
canonical browser documents. Simulator reset requires the same writer lease as
its reducers. Their recovery and verification contracts live in
[browser storage](browser-storage.md); they are not outstanding migrations here.
This does not establish a passing result for every engine or live provider.

`prototype/clock-adapter.ts` uses its `alphaphone:clock-handoff:v1` record for the
native handoff UI. The browser path opens the simulated Clock directly, and mock
requests do not write the record. Audit native handoff retention separately:
completion compares an operation ID before a separate localStorage write, and
initial retention currently lacks readback. Do not present this record as an
outstanding browser Clock journal or as proof an alarm was created.

## Remaining review

Specify winner, refresh and retirement semantics for connection/environment,
appearance and simulated location preferences, then qualify their callers.
Conversation choices, Notes and audio-deletion records now have canonical document
implementations; their contracts and owning suites are in
[browser storage](browser-storage.md). A domain migration does not establish
native or physical-device acceptance.

## Qualification and remaining product gates

For each migrated domain, cover real IndexedDB write failure, two independent
pages, late owner changes, exact malformed backup, stale reset, tab termination
and retained unknown outcomes. Reuse shared transactional storage; product keys,
UI policy and recovery copy belong in Alpha. Native receipt storage must keep its
existing secure contract.

Browser and root verification qualify their exact source only. Current native
IPC, Android process/reboot/Doze behavior, real Gmail and Cloud grants, provider
revocation, installed autofill, physical speech and signed release/pilot journeys
remain separate items in [current MVP status](mvp-current-status.md). This audit neither waives those gates nor represents the MVP as complete.
