# #662 Build and sign the distributable release APKs (H-10)

Owner preparation for [issue #662](https://github.com/eliza-research/alphaphone/issues/662),
[human actions](../human-actions.md) H-10. This is the release owner's procedure on the release
build host. It records no result. Everything it produces is **APK-build evidence only**: not an
emulator HOME-role test, an image boot, a device result or user acceptance.

The cycle-1 PR list is the orchestration's record of upstream PRs; the merge state and commits were
read from GitHub. This prerequisite of the issue is met at this pin; a later repin must re-check it.

### `npm run android:build:inputs`

| State | Input | Supplied by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ready | pinned upstream checkout (`vendor/eliza` at the pin) | script |
| **PERSON** | on-device voice outputs in `.eliza/paradee-voice/native` (not staged; Gradle `:app:verifyVoiceHost` rejects a distribution build) | H-18: `node scripts/android-stage-voice-models.mjs --from <directory>` ([fused speech](../fused-speech.md)) |
| **PERSON** | on-device voice host qualified (`android/voice-host/qualified-voice-host.json` is `qualified: false`) | H-18 named reviewer |
| script | embedding host libraries (`libelizainference.so`, `libelizavoicejni.so`, `libc++_shared.so`) | `npm run agent:build-embedding-host` (part of `android:build:local`) |
| script | prepared resident runtime source, workflow worker, staged resident payload, embedding model | `android:build:local` chain |
| ready | Gradle dependency verification metadata | committed |
| **PERSON** | release signer (`android/release-signer.json` is `unset`; no `ELIZAOS_KEYSTORE_*` set) | H-08/H-09 (#661), then H-10 signing |

Three person-supplied inputs are missing: the voice outputs, the voice host qualification and the
release signer. The embedding host (H-19) is script-supplied at this pin.

### `npm run human:status` (release rows)

- H-09 `open`: 12 of 12 release digests unset.
- H-10 `open`: no `artifacts/apk-manifest.json` in this checkout; no `lastRelease`; no
  `ELIZAOS_KEYSTORE_*` variable; `ELIZAOS_APP_LINK_HOST` unset.
- H-18 `open`: `qualified: false` (device executed: true, emulator executed: true, user accepted: false).
- H-19 `not needed`: script-supplied while `remapBuildPath` is true.

No agent ran the build chain or Gradle for this issue.

## Decisions for the owner

### D1. Gradle signing or post-build signing? Settled by the 2026-10-29 custody decision

H-01 is decided: the keys live as GitHub Actions secrets, and a CI job signs
([#661 D1](661-release-key-custody-ceremony.md#d1-h-01-where-do-the-release-keys-live-after-the-ceremony-decided-2026-10-29)).
That makes post-build signing the path: build **unsigned** on the release build host, then run
the draft `sign-apks` job
([drafts/661-release-signing.workflow.yml](drafts/661-release-signing.workflow.yml)). The job
decrypts only `alphaphone_app` into tmpfs, runs `sign-release-apks.mjs --keys-dir ... --no-verify`
(the signer check against `android/release-signer.json` still runs), and shreds the key. Gradle
signing (`ELIZAOS_KEYSTORE_*`) is not used. It would need a keystore that the ceremony does not
produce, and the passwords would sit in the build environment for the whole build. The PKCS#11
form is kept only for a later move to custody B or C.

The remaining choice here is the input transport, [#661 D2](661-release-key-custody-ceremony.md#d2-how-do-unsigned-inputs-reach-the-ci-signing-job).

### D2. Version code and name

`ELIZAOS_VERSION_CODE` must exceed `lastRelease.versionCode` (currently `null`, so any positive
integer is admitted). The highest development versionCode recorded in `docs/evidence` is 17.
Recommendation: a code above every development build that pilot units may still have installed
(for example 100), and a `ELIZAOS_VERSION_NAME` that names the Alpha commit and Eliza pin. What it
changes: once H-32 records this release as `lastRelease`, every later build and every
`pilot-update` must advance it; a code that is too low cannot be undone.

### D3. App Links host

H-10 builds with `ELIZAOS_APP_LINK_HOST=eliza.app`; without it, builds declare no verified App
Links filters and H-13 cannot be verified on the device. Default: set it.

## Procedure (release owner, release build host)

Prerequisites: #661 done (H-09 `done`), H-18 admitted, this pin (or a later one re-checked).

1. On a clean checkout of the release commit: `git submodule update --init vendor/eliza`; confirm
   `npm run android:build:inputs` shows the pin `ready`.
2. Stage the person inputs it lists:
   `node scripts/android-stage-voice-models.mjs --from <directory of the recorded voice outputs and models>`
   (H-18; see [fused speech](../fused-speech.md)). Re-run `npm run android:build:inputs`: the only
   remaining `PERSON` row must be the release signer (it does not stop the build).
3. `npm run verify`.
4. Build both distribution variants with the strict chain (never `--allow-unpackaged-runtime`,
   never `ELIZA_DEV_ALLOW_TEST_MOCKS=1`):
   ```sh
   ELIZAOS_VERSION_CODE=<D2> ELIZAOS_VERSION_NAME=<D2> ELIZAOS_APP_LINK_HOST=eliza.app \
     npm run android:build:local
   ```
   (with the four `ELIZAOS_KEYSTORE_*` variables only if D1 chose Gradle signing).
5. Sign in CI (D1), following [#661 CI signing path step 5](661-release-key-custody-ceremony.md#5-run):
   ```sh
   tar -cf unsigned-release.tar -C artifacts standalone-release-unsigned.apk launcher-release-unsigned.apk \
     build-config.json apk-manifest.json            # add sense-listener-unsigned.apk if prepared
   sha256sum unsigned-release.tar                   # typed into the dispatch form with the URL
   ```
   Dispatch `Release signing (draft)` with `target=apks` once it is enabled, and approve the
   `release` gate after checking the workflow file at that commit. Download
   `signed-release-apks-<run>` into `artifacts/` on this same build tree, remove the two
   `*-release-unsigned.apk` files, then run:
   ```sh
   node scripts/verify-apks.mjs
   node scripts/generate-sbom.mjs --out artifacts/sbom/alphaphone.cdx.json --apks artifacts --packaged-runtime
   ```
   (`--packaged-runtime` applies when the resident runtime is staged, as it is for a distributable build.)
   No key ever reaches the build host.
6. Check: both release rows (`standalone`, `launcher`) of `artifacts/apk-manifest.json` read
   `distributable: true`; `node scripts/audit-production-bundle.mjs` passes; `npm run human:status`
   shows H-10 `done`.
7. Do **not** run `scripts/record-release.mjs --write` yet: `lastRelease` is recorded only after
   distribution (H-32).
8. Keep `artifacts/apk-manifest.json`, both APKs, the signed listener APK and the build log as the
   release build record; these feed H-21 (#672).

## Draft decision entries

```markdown
- **P-5x — H-10 ([#662](https://github.com/eliza-research/alphaphone/issues/662)), decided <YYYY-MM-DD> by Shaw:**
  Release APKs are built unsigned on the release build host and signed by the CI release-signing job
  (P-57) with scripts/sign-release-apks.mjs from key files decrypted into tmpfs for one step. The first pilot release uses versionCode <N> and
  versionName <name>; ELIZAOS_APP_LINK_HOST=eliza.app. Policy only, not build evidence.
```

## Remaining human steps

1. Finish #661 (custody, ceremony, enrollment).
2. H-18 reviewer: stage and admit the on-device voice outputs (`qualified: true`).
3. Release owner: choose D2 and the #661 D2 transport, then run the procedure above (build on the
   release build host, sign in CI, verify on the build host).
4. Confirm both `distributable: true` rows and H-10 `done`; hand the manifest and APKs to the image
   host operator for #672.
