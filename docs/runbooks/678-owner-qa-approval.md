# #678 Owner per-view approval and Seeker review of the MVP rows (H-38)

Owner preparation for [#678](https://github.com/eliza-research/alphaphone/issues/678) and
[human action](../human-actions.md) H-38. Agents prepared a report and a cross-check; they did not
set, and must never set, `items[].userApproval`. The Seeker column (`items[].seeker`) is filled from
the installed build with the device operator. Neither column is changed on this branch.

Prepared on this branch:

- `node scripts/owner/qa-approval-report.mjs [--json] [--out <file>]` reads
  `docs/app-qa-checklist.json` and `docs/app-qa-checklist.md` and prints the report below.
- `test/owner-qa-approval-report.test.mjs` checks that the report's counts equal the H-38 line of
  `npm run human:status`, on the committed checklist.

## Read-only findings (2026-10-28)

1. `npm run human:status` prints for H-38: "0 of 169 MVP rows approved by the owner; 135 still have
   no Seeker result". The report rebuilds both numbers from the JSON with the same predicates, and
   they agree. 169 MVP rows of 174 (1 deferred by the user, 3 AOSP only, 1 excluded).
2. human:status counts a row as having no Seeker result only when the Seeker value **starts with**
   "Pending". Seven more rows say the Seeker result is pending, unproven or not attempted without
   starting with "Pending" (`inbox-agent-mailbox`, `calendar-06`, `calendar-11`, `calendar-16`,
   `calendar-18`, `settings-google-account-controls`, `platform-native-google-broker`); human:status
   counts them as having a result. Read literally, 142 rows still lack a Seeker result.
3. The JSON has no separate `implemented` or `tested` field. The agent-filled columns are
   `implementation` (17 of 169 filled; 152 read "Needs review against current source") and
   `preview`, the preview QA column (65 filled, 104 "Pending…").
4. The Markdown page disagrees with the JSON on 18 rows (preview or Seeker cell), so an owner reading
   the page sees older values than human:status reads. The JSON is the record; regenerate the page
   or review from this report.
5. One row links prompt-proof evidence that is missing: `calendar-17` names
   `LATEST-CALENDAR-APPROVAL-STATUS.json`, which is not in the repository. Only 15 rows carry any
   evidence file and 8 a prompt-proof file; the rest have no per-row proof to open.
6. There is one preview for every row: `http://127.0.0.1:5209/`, a loopback address that exists only
   on the machine serving it, recorded at product `f0c7a79a7` on 2026-10-17. Before a review session,
   start the preview from the release candidate and note its commit; the checklist's preview cells
   describe the October 17 build.
7. human:status counts a row approved only when `userApproval` starts with "Approved". The issue
   allows "approved (or a filed defect)", but a row whose value names a defect keeps H-38 open (see
   Decisions).

## Review procedure per row

In the order the checklist gives, for each MVP row:

1. **Latest preview.** Open the preview at the candidate commit and the row's view; check light and
   dark, compact portrait, landscape, large text, keyboard and safe area, Back, reload and
   background, and the empty, loading, offline, error and denied states that apply.
2. **Deployed backend and prompt proof.** Open the row's evidence files in the report (where none is
   listed, there is no recorded prompt proof for that row; ask for one or record its absence).
3. **Installed build on the Seeker**, with the device operator: the exact installed APK SHA-256,
   gesture navigation and smoothness on the current Android build. The operator writes the result
   into `items[].seeker` (and the page), starting with "Pending" if it is not complete.
4. **Your approval.** Only you write `items[].userApproval`. Write `Approved <yyyy-mm-dd> at <commit>`
   for a row you personally accepted, or `Defect #<issue>` for a filed defect.

After each session: commit the JSON and the regenerated page together in a reviewed change, then run
`npm run human:status` and `node scripts/owner/qa-approval-report.mjs` and check that both counts
moved as expected.

## Decisions for the owner

| Question | Options | Documented default / recommendation | What each choice changes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Does a filed defect close a row for H-38? | (a) only "Approved…" counts (current script); (b) "Defect #n" also counts as reviewed | (a) is what `scripts/human-actions.mjs` does today; the issue text allows (b) | (a) H-38 stays open until every defect is fixed and re-approved; (b) needs a change to the H-38 check and makes "done" mean "reviewed", not "accepted" |
| Should pending-wording Seeker cells count as pending? | (a) keep the prefix rule; (b) also match pending/unproven/not attempted | (a) current | (b) raises the pending count from 135 to 142 today and keeps the count honest when an operator writes free text |
| Which file is the record? | JSON only (page regenerated from it); or both edited by hand | human:status reads only the JSON | Hand-editing both caused the 18 disagreements; regenerating removes them |
| What "latest preview" means | the preview of the release candidate (#662 build commit); or any current preview | Not set | Approvals against an older preview do not describe the release build |
| Seeker review device and build | the Seeker with the current installed build; or wait for the release APK | The checklist reviews the installed Seeker build | Reviewing before #662 means re-checking the Seeker column after the release build is installed |

## Remaining human steps

1. Start the preview at the candidate commit; note the commit.
2. With the device operator, review each MVP row in checklist order (preview, backend and prompt
   proof, installed Seeker build with gesture navigation and smoothness), recording `seeker`.
3. Record your own `userApproval` for each row you personally accept, or file a defect.
4. Commit the JSON and regenerated page; `npm run human:status` shows H-38 done when all 169 rows
   start with "Approved".

## Draft decision entries

Drafts for `docs/decisions.md`; the owner assigns numbers and dates.

- **P-NN — H-38 ([#678](https://github.com/eliza-research/alphaphone/issues/678)):** A row counts as done for H-38 when `userApproval` is `<only "Approved…" | "Approved…" or "Defect #n">`; the Seeker column counts as pending when it `<starts with "Pending" | says pending, unproven or not attempted anywhere>`; `docs/app-qa-checklist.json` is the record and the page is regenerated from it.

## Report: MVP rows by surface

Generated by `node scripts/owner/qa-approval-report.mjs` from `docs/app-qa-checklist.json` (updated 2026-10-17T23:08:00Z, product f0c7a79a7). Regenerate before each review; do not edit the table by hand.

- MVP rows: 169; owner-approved: 0.
- Agent columns: implementation filled on 17, preview QA filled on 65. The JSON has no separate `implemented` or `tested` field; `implementation` and `preview` are the agent-filled columns.
- Seeker: 27 rows record a result; 135 start with "Pending" (what `npm run human:status` counts); 7 more say pending/unproven/not attempted without starting with "Pending" and are counted by human:status as having a result.
- Rows with any evidence file: 15; with a prompt-proof file: 8; evidence files named but missing: 1.
- Rows where docs/app-qa-checklist.md disagrees with the JSON (preview, Seeker or approval cell): 18. The JSON is the record human:status reads.
- Preview: http://127.0.0.1:5209/ (one loopback preview for every row; it exists only on the machine that serves it).
